atmospheric explosions , or full combustion , takes about 15,000 times longer than what happens in your car .
and each one of the 11 chapters of the ipcc has six to ten subsections .
now you &apos;ve seen before that with electrodes you can control robotic arms , that brain imaging and scanners can show you the insides of brains .
you will be able to look at all the aspects that make you yourself , all your experiences .
the film that changed my life is a 1951 film by vittorio de sica , &quot; miracle in milan . &quot;
a tsunami of questions flew out of the mouths of children who the world didn &apos;t think were interested .
if we want different values we have to tell a different story , a story that understands that an individual narrative is an essential component of a person &apos;s identity , that a collective narrative is an essential component of a cultural identity , and without it it is impossible to imagine yourself as part of a group .
the only thing that got us through that period was that we knew that all over the world , there were other people that were trying to do the same thing that we were .
it &apos;s a study at harvard where , at the end of the study , they &apos;re going to take my entire genomic sequence , all of my medical information , and my identity , and they &apos;re going to post it online for everyone to see .
it &apos;s spaces like these that spawned personal computing .
so , okay , i &apos;m going to america .
and then always the same thing happens : people are watching each other and think , &quot; oh , my god .
roberto d &apos;angelo and francesca fedeli thought their baby boy mario was healthy -- until at 10 days old , they discovered he &apos;d had a perinatal stroke . with mario unable to control the left side of his body , they grappled with tough questions : would he be &quot; normal ? &quot; could he live a full life ? the poignant story of parents facing their fears -- and how they turned them around .
i mean , at the end , will he be able to work ?
but we want to share what was the key learning , the key learning that mario drove to us , and it is to consider what you have as a gift and not only what you miss , and to consider what you miss just as an opportunity .
did you guess the one that was dry ?
so imagine how something like this could help revolutionize your field of work .
and about three years later , when i left the hospital , i started studying at the university .
is it the case that there was kind of a few apples who are capable of doing these things , or are we talking a more endemic situation , that many people are actually capable of behaving this way ?
some people shredded the whole sheet of paper .
the first experiment -- i walked around mit and i distributed six-packs of cokes in the refrigerators -- these were common refrigerators for the undergrads .
they cheat just by a little bit , all the same .
we &apos;ve learned that a lot of people can cheat .
and she said maybe part of the reason was it was difficult for her .
we could even have four thumbs together , and the way you win is you &apos;re the first person to pin someone else &apos;s thumb .
thirty seconds . into the network . make the node .
we had excitement . as you started to wrestle , maybe you &apos;re starting to win or this person &apos;s , like , really into it , so you kind of get the excitement going .
i will just leave you with this tip , if you want to play again .
since then , i &apos;ve played other places that are much nicer .
if they liked an aria , they would holler and suggest that it be done again as an encore , not at the end of the show , but immediately .
and they &apos;d say , &quot; play that part again . &quot;
and , as with jazz , the dancers liked certain sections more than they did others .
the tananger on the east coast of the united states , where the forests are a little denser , has one kind of call , and the tananger on the other side , on the west has a different kind of call .
that &apos;s the life everyone sees .
so what ? we look at that , and we go , &quot; that &apos;s your problem .
that &apos;s what keeps you from getting help .
and know that you &apos;re sick , you &apos;re not weak , and it &apos;s an issue , not an identity , because when you get past the fear and the ridicule and the judgment and the stigma of others , you can see depression for what it really is , and that &apos;s just a part of life , just a part of life , and as much as i hate , as much as i hate some of the places , some of the parts of my life depression has dragged me down to , in a lot of ways i &apos;m grateful for it .
we have this war with iran coming for 10 years now , and we have people , you know , afraid .
and that &apos;s how it started . and that &apos;s how , really , it &apos;s unleashed , because suddenly people from facebook , friends and others , just understand that they can be part of it .
they said , &quot; syria ? &quot; &quot; syria . &quot;
this is the enemy .
i know how it can look really bad .
in spite of deposit fees , much of this trash leading out to the sea will be plastic beverage bottles .
i thought i would spend 20 bucks .
this is brian rooney for nightline , in long beach , california .
although at the same time we &apos;re losing an equivalent amount of existing arables to salinization and erosion .
but of course not all of them were that small .
so it was coming in , and arriving at the city at the northwest , which is why smithfield , london &apos;s very famous meat market , was located up there .
it &apos;s the final emancipation of the city from any apparent relationship with nature at all .
the ordering principle of his vision .
it &apos;s part of the social life of the city .
we know we are what we eat .
we really needed to do some archeology in the trailer itself to figure out what &apos;s authentic in an airstream trailer , and what feels like it has true purpose and utility .
a lot of these ideas migrated into the production trailers for airstream .
please keep your seat .
in your house , wires run in the wall , from the light switch to a junction box in the ceiling and from the junction box to the light bulb .
the future holds the promise that new drugs will be developed that are not symptom-modifying drugs that simply mask the problem , as we have now , but that will be disease-modifying drugs that will actually go right to the root of the problem and attack those glial cells , or those pernicious proteins that the glial cells elaborate , that spill over and cause this central nervous system wind-up , or plasticity , that so is capable of distorting and amplifying the sensory experience that we call pain .
the disease was so terrifying that the president of the united states launched an extraordinary national effort to find a way to stop it .
it &apos;s just happening in another part of the world .
and polio eradication , in many ways , is even tougher , and there &apos;s a few reasons for that .
this is a group whose million-strong army of volunteers have been working to eradicate polio for over 20 years .
these are children like umar .
now june the ninth , 2009 , we got the first results from the first trial with this vaccine , and it turned out to be a game-changer .
but as david cameron of the united kingdom said about a month ago when he was talking about polio , &quot; there &apos;s never a wrong time to do the right thing . &quot;
but when you &apos;re reaching 500 million children multiple times -- 20 , 30 cents to reach a child -- that &apos;s not very much money .
i don &apos;t know .
he said , &quot; for three years , my girlfriend and i , we &apos;ve made it this sunday morning ritual to visit the postsecret blog together and read the secrets out loud .
he turns four tomorrow . &quot;
i &apos;ve later come to know that to be the collective socialization of men , better known as the &quot; man box . &quot;
i think back to my father .
and he did spend a lot of time up to no good .
that &apos;s even worse . we &apos;re supposed to always be on the prowl .
we kind of see ourselves separate , but we &apos;re very much a part of it .
then you load the aircraft , and then you stand up and you get on , and you kind of lumber to the aircraft like this , in a line of people , and you sit down on canvas seats on either side of the aircraft .
and then when it &apos;s time to go , a green light goes and the jumpmaster goes , &quot; go . &quot;
they &apos;d be doing everything that we had taught them .
they put a big screen up , and they take you through everything : &quot; and then you didn &apos;t do this , and you didn &apos;t do this , etc . &quot;
and so instead of giving orders , you &apos;re now building consensus and you &apos;re building a sense of shared purpose .
and you have to watch and take care of each other .
thank you .
so one day she said , openly , i &apos;m not going to support this research .
that &apos;s why i am giving this machine only in rural india , for rural women , because in india , &#91; you &apos;ll be &#93; surprised , only two percent of women are using sanitary pads . the rest , they &apos;re using a rag cloth , a leaf , husk , &#91; saw &#93; dust , everything except sanitary pads .
there is nothing bigger or older than the universe .
i now turn to the second big question : are we alone , or is there other life in the universe ?
that is why i am in favor of manned -- or should i say , personed -- space flight .
only months later , i discover who he really was .
he built a playhouse for our daughter .
i say , &quot; keep him alive if you can . &quot;
now , what do the experts call this ?
maybe i wanted to believe it .
and the poet tells him what to do .
the brazil ornithological society -- so now we &apos;re talking only birds -- claims that we have too little knowledge about the species in nature .
and on one side of the bunk bed , i had put out all of my g.i. joe soldiers and weaponry .
what we found is -- if i got this data back studying you here in the room , i would be thrilled , because there &apos;s very clearly a trend that &apos;s going on there , and that means that i can get published , which is all that really matters .
i have a brother in-law named bobo -- which is a whole other story .
because what that question assumes is that our external world is predictive of our happiness levels , when in reality , if i know everything about your external world , i can only predict 10 percent of your long-term happiness .
what we &apos;ve done is we &apos;ve pushed happiness over the cognitive horizon as a society .
what motivates us to work ? contrary to conventional wisdom , it isn &apos;t just money . but it &apos;s not exactly joy either . it seems that most of us thrive by making constant progress and feeling a sense of purpose . behavioral economist dan ariely presents two eye-opening experiments that reveal our unexpected and nuanced attitudes toward meaning in our work . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
and the day before it was due , he sent his powerpoint presentation to his boss , and his boss wrote him back and said , &quot; nice presentation , but the merger is canceled . &quot;
we asked people , &quot; would you like to build one bionicle for three dollars ? &quot;
in that condition the correlation was zero .
we took a sheet of paper with random letters , and we asked people to find pairs of letters that were identical next to each other .
the bad news is that ignoring the performance of people is almost as bad as shredding their effort in front of their eyes .
it was as if you bought it in the store .
for some people we made it harder by hiding the instructions .
and indeed , this is a great example and the reason for the industrial revolution and efficiency .
it &apos;s a hotel that &apos;s only open until midnight , so it &apos;s not a place that you stay .
this is the skyline of my hometown , new orleans .
that &apos;s where half of vietnam &apos;s rice is grown .
i &apos;m going to do that in two steps .
so really , this is how i would like to describe it .
it &apos;s actually a sensible way of coping with the inevitability of aging .
basically , gerontology is a fine approach in the end , but it is not an approach whose time has come when we &apos;re talking about intervention .
they will mostly survive long enough to receive improved treatments that will give them a further 30 or maybe 50 years .
and then we do a whole bunch of stuff to them , and with those therapies , we get them to live , on average , to their fifth birthday .
but it is not part of metabolism itself .
cell loss , mutations in chromosomes , mutations in the mitochondria and so on .
so , you know , this does happen .
ag : if you lose a bit of weight .
and i remember getting out of the water and my hands feeling so painful and looking down at my fingers , and my fingers were literally the size of sausages because -- you know , we &apos;re made partially of water -- when water freezes it expands , and so the cells in my fingers had frozen and expanded and burst .
and to the right hand side of us was this great khumbu glacier .
we want you to walk up the mountain in two days &apos; time , and instead of swimming fast , swim as slowly as possible .
today i &apos;m going to unpack for you three examples of iconic design , and it makes perfect sense that i should be the one to do it because i have a bachelor &apos;s degree in literature .
does anyone know ? chi ?
that &apos;s what i want to talk about .
&quot; picture in a frame , ashes in a bottle , boundless energy confined in the bottle , forcing me to deal with reality , forcing me to deal with being grown up .
should it be by just walking around looking down ?
and the other really unexpected surprise was the camera .
and that when being vulnerable emerged from my data , as absolutely essential to whole-hearted living , i told these 500 people that i had a breakdown .
she said , &quot; you &apos;re like the worst vulnerability role model ever . &quot;
our family motto is &quot; lock and load . &quot;
myshkin ingawale , i hope i did right by you .
that &apos;s what life is about , about daring greatly , about being in the arena .
it &apos;s uncomfortable , but it &apos;s adaptive .
and to get out from underneath it , to find our way back to each other , we have to understand how it affects us and how it affects the way we &apos;re parenting , the way we &apos;re working , the way we &apos;re looking at each other .
it was just extraordinary , and when i came back home i found a poem by the mexican poet octavio paz , and decided to set it to music , a piece for choir called &quot; cloudburst , &quot; which is the piece that we &apos;ll perform for you in just a moment .
i felt shy , i felt embarrassed .
or you could actually meet my need .
the digital universe atlas has been built at the american museum of natural history over the past 12 years .
this software can also be networked between domes .
these are some of the questions that are at the center of my exploration on the nature of erotic desire and its concomitant dilemmas in modern love .
but then i took a question with me .
novelty is , what parts of you do you bring out ?
and then i began to ask the reverse question .
&quot; are you going to be there ?
&lt; speaker &gt; nalini nadkarni &lt; / speaker &gt;
they &apos;ve incurred violent infractions by becoming violent with guards and with other prisoners .
tm : thank you very much .
so we exert control over the form by specifying the position of where we &apos;re making the fold , but essentially you &apos;re looking at a folded cube .
i chose to design a column .
what you &apos;re looking at here is an x-ray of the column that you just saw , viewed from the top .
filmmaker david hoffman shares footage from his feature-length documentary sputnik mania , which shows how the soviet union &apos;s launch of sputnik in 1957 led to both the space race and the arms race -- and jump-started science and math education around the world .
support for engineering , math and science -- education in general -- boomed .
and i do believe that the answer to that is going to be leadership .
it &apos;s not about selling soap , it &apos;s about making sure that in the process of doing so you can change people &apos;s lives .
and my mother packed me a suitcase full of books , which to me seemed like a perfectly natural thing to do .
and i was always going off to crowded bars when i really would have preferred to just have a nice dinner with friends .
now in fact , some of our transformative leaders in history have been introverts .
it &apos;s only recently that we &apos;ve strangely begun to forget it .
so that &apos;s the world we &apos;re living in today .
and so these days i try to learn from my grandfather &apos;s example in my own way .
i &apos;m not saying that we all have to now go off and build our own cabins in the woods and never talk to each other again , but i am saying that we could all stand to unplug and get inside our own heads a little more often .
and i saw something extraordinary happening in silicon valley , so i wanted to be there , and i saw that the computer was coming into our homes , that it had to change in order to be with us in our homes .
and just by drawing on a little computer tablet , the entire light fixture adjusts to what shape you want .
but this is the design process : there &apos;s somebody changing the board , putting tracers on the board , changing the location of the ics , as the designers on the other side are doing the work .
this girl is going to school with a laptop on her head .
like paper , paper and cardboard .
i want to talk about what is happening now in our scientific , biotechnological culture , where , for really the first time in history , we have the power to design bodies , to design animal bodies , to design human bodies .
this is a cama .
there is no area of the government -- not the epa or the fda -- that controls genetically-engineered pets .
this lovely creature is an asian cockroach .
the computer learned what the monkey brain did to move its arm in various ways .
and so , asks the economist : &quot; the first artificial organism and its consequences . &quot;
the main characteristics of such a system is that there &apos;s one sole contact point to the ground .
all right , thank you , thomas .
she and i were both very pregnant at that time , and my heart just ached for her , imagining how afraid she must be .
it &apos;s a stronger risk factor than having a mother or a sister with breast cancer .
and he happened to tell me about a conference he &apos;d just returned from in israel , where they were talking about a new type of gamma detector .
so here &apos;s an example .
but i suspect even the non-radiologists in the room can find the tumor on the mbi image .
the babies that we were carrying when my patient first asked me this question are now both in middle school , and the answer has been so slow to come .
but you can also search in the digital world , or maybe you can write a query , saying , &quot; what is dr. smith &apos;s address ? &quot;
but later , i realized that i actually wanted to interact with those digital pixels , also .
this was obama &apos;s visit last week to mit .
paper world is interesting to play with .
pm : there is a lot of energy here . lots of learning .
desperate for a solution , we &apos;ve turned to engineering to design artificial components to replace our worn-out body parts , but in the midst of the modern buzz around the promises of a bionic body , shouldn &apos;t we stop and ask if there &apos;s a better , more natural way ?
so my story in working with animal tissues starts in 1984 .
it &apos;s not hardware .
it &apos;s a number -- very large -- a contribution to the economy of the united states for free .
well we &apos;ve seen already that quite some of you already ate insects maybe occasionally , but i can tell you that every one of you is eating insects , without any exception .
there was an fao conference last october that was completely devoted to this .
and a pig disease , a pig virus , and a human virus can both proliferate , and because of their kind of reproduction , they can combine and produce a new virus .
so that &apos;s four points for insects .
and in fact , without insects , we would not be here in this room , because if the insects die out , we will soon die out as well .
marcel dicke : it &apos;s all protein .
let &apos;s think about your ethical footprint .
we did the line install over the summer .
when they have their kids , 2050 , they &apos;d better look back at grandpa and say , &quot; hey , you gave it a good shot . you did the best you could with the team that you had . &quot;
then i was very lucky to win the competition to build the second pompidou center in france in the city of metz .
but over two million people cut trees .
then i wonder , what is a permanent and what is a temporary building ?
so we went there to build partitions with all the student volunteers with paper tubes , just a very simple shelter out of the tube frame and the curtain .
and we &apos;re going to try to understand what &apos;s happening in his brain .
and indeed , on the inputs to the hippocampus , cells are found which project into the hippocampus , which do respond exactly to detecting boundaries or edges at particular distances and directions from the rat or mouse as it &apos;s exploring around .
he &apos;s probably remembering where his car was in terms of the distances and directions to extended buildings and boundaries around the location where he parked .
so i went back to work , and i &apos;ve spent these seven years since struggling with , studying and writing about work-life balance .
have sex again .
because people say , &quot; bloody hell mate , i haven &apos;t got time to get fit .
and , consequently , most people -- i think most people probably here -- think that science will never answer the most important questions in human life : questions like , &quot; what is worth living for ? &quot;
perhaps there are other states that we can &apos;t access because of how our minds are structured but other minds possibly could access them .
so , for instance , if it &apos;s really wrong to lie , it must always be wrong to lie , and if you can find an exception , well then there &apos;s no such thing as moral truth .
perhaps there are many such places -- again , given other changes in human culture there may be many peaks on the moral landscape .
i wouldn &apos;t want to belong to any string theory club that would have me as a member .
but can you reconcile that ?
&quot; what &apos;s up with the chinese character i keep seeing by the side of the road ? &quot;
one reason , actually , has to do with a feeling of being wrong .
but there &apos;s a second reason that we get stuck inside this feeling as well -- and this one is cultural .
this internal sense of rightness that we all experience so often is not a reliable guide to what is actually going on in the external world .
because , unlike god , we don &apos;t really know what &apos;s going on out there .
for good and for ill , we generate these incredible stories about the world around us , and then the world turns around and astonishes us .
but today , this thing is , i believe , a major player in the politics of the middle east .
this is probably the first real press release by a victorious army that we &apos;ve got .
this empire is , in fact , the middle east as we now know it , and it &apos;s what shapes the middle east as we now know it .
but -- and this , of course , is where it becomes complicated -- the facts were true , hurrah for archeology , but the interpretation was rather more complicated .
and the response to this by the jewish population in eastern europe is rhapsodic .
and in the current iran , zoroastrians and christians have guaranteed places in the iranian parliament , something to be very , very proud of .
hacker and writer joshua klein is fascinated by crows . after a long amateur study of corvid behavior , he &apos;s come up with an elegant thought experiment : a machine that could form a new bond between animal and human .
so , i thought , let &apos;s build something that &apos;s mutually beneficial .
but she did it all on her own .
the problem now is collecting the bits , without getting run over .
and eventually , they eat up all the peanuts .
that crow enjoys a temporary monopoly on peanuts , until his friends figure out how to do it , and then there we go .
but when we talked to people , it appeared that a funnel effect had happened in these tribes all across the united states .
but let &apos;s move on to stage two .
now imagine having a whole room of people saying , in effect , &quot; i &apos;m great and you &apos;re not . &quot;
but you &apos;ll notice the level of excitement .
the first one , if you look at the declaration of independence and actually read it , the phrase that sticks in many of our minds is things about inalienable rights .
he went from being alive and passionate at stage one -- remember , &quot; life sucks , despairing hostility , i will do whatever it takes to survive &quot; -- to walking into a boys and girls club , folding his arms , sitting down in a chair , and saying , &quot; wow . my life really sucks .
and the question that i &apos;d like to leave you with is this : will your tribes change the world ?
a close look at how the technology works : these are channels that are about the size of a human hair -- so you have integrated valves , pumps , mixers and injectors -- so you can fit entire diagnostic experiments onto a microfluidic system .
most pollen that causes hay fever for us is from plants that use the wind to disseminate the pollen , and that &apos;s a very inefficient process , which is why it gets up our noses so much .
this is a plant here that insects in south africa just love , and they &apos;ve evolved with a long proboscis to get the nectar at the bottom .
they fly in and they pollinate .
there &apos;s a thermoregulation mechanism in there that keeps constant temperature .
just in case you think that all yellow flowers have this property -- no flower was damaged in the process of this shot ; it was just attached to the tripod , not killed -- then under ultraviolet light , look at that .
osama bin laden will be dead , and ratko mladic will be in the hague . &quot;
i &apos;m meeting different people throughout the world , and they are , you know , academics and professors and doctors , and they will always talk conditions .
it &apos;s selection of strategies and tactics .
sounds loud . and within the minutes , we were sitting in a nearby cafe having coffee , and there was a queue of people waiting to do this lovely thing .
will these revolutions be whole like through the transitions to democracy or be overtaken by military or extremists of all kinds ? we cannot tell .
there is a story about olof palme , the swedish prime minister , going to see ronald reagan in america in the 1980s .
take , therefore , what modern technology is capable of : the power of our moral sense allied to the power of communications and our ability to organize internationally .
one of the things that has got to come out of copenhagen in the next few months is an agreement that there will be a global environmental institution that is able to deal with the problems of persuading the whole of the world to move along a climate-change agenda .
making people laugh .
a few months ago , i got a phone call from a nursing home where i work .
but it &apos;s completely silent , like a silent movie . &quot;
she said , &quot; did he have them himself ? &quot;
they are rather sudden , and they change suddenly .
and especially she saw cartoons of kermit the frog .
and the temporal lobe hallucinations are all-sense hallucinations , full of feeling , full of familiarity , located in space and time , coherent , dramatic .
i had to bring it in .
thanks very much .
i had all kinds of rats , mice , hamsters , gerbils , squirrels .
they &apos;re extremely sensitive to smell .
especially in africa where t.b. and hiv are strongly linked , there is a huge common problem .
throughout last year , we &apos;ve been -- depending on which intervals you take -- we &apos;ve been consistently increasing case detection rates in five hospitals in dar es salaam between 30 and 40 percent .
and i &apos;m going do that also by looking at what i think is part of my creative process , which includes a number of things that happened , actually -- the nothing started even earlier than the moment in which i &apos;m creating something new .
my father was a baptist minister , and he believed in miracles , and that god &apos;s will would take care of that .
and it &apos;s the same thing in looking at these questions of how things happen .
so their way of rationalizing that is they are saving the fish from drowning , and unfortunately , in the process the fish die .
and you are noticing it more often .
in this case , i was writing a story that included some kind of detail , period of history , a certain location .
a big thing that i also think about is accidents .
but i go back to this question of , how do i create something out of nothing ?
but i want to start and go back to the 1930s .
it was just him directly connected with his audience and building on the feedback and enthusiasm that they were giving him .
things like invisible obama or the famous &quot; binders full of women &quot; that came up during the 2012 election cycle , or even the fan fiction universe of &quot; west wing &quot; twitter in which you have all of these accounts for every single one of the characters in &quot; the west wing , &quot; including the bird that taps at josh lyman &apos;s window in one single episode .
and i think this is an interesting experiment in format .
hacking is really just any amateur innovation on an existing system , and it is a deeply democratic activity .
now the site itself was easy enough to build , but the team was faced with the challenge of how they populate all of the content .
and in those 10 days , they submitted 173 apps , five of which were presented to congress and are still in the app store today .
yes , breast cancer .
how do you not get overwhelmed by the despair and the misery of it all ?
my story is the power of a metaphor .
and she was hot .
and if i took that journey , no matter whether it failed or succeeded , it would be completely irrelevant .
and very quickly , some letters started coming back .
i &apos;m cutting my hair , it &apos;s getting short and long , because every time i saw kofi annan , i was so worried that he thought i was a hippie that i cut it , and that was kind of what was going on .
if this is the only film that i ever make , i &apos;m going to document until this becomes a reality . &quot;
it &apos;s just symbolism .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go to afghanistan . &quot; he said , &quot; really ? &quot;
we will observe this day .
and on the 21st of september this year , we &apos;re going to launch that campaign at the o2 arena to go for that process , to try and create the largest recorded cessation of hostilities .
it &apos;s all about you and me .
that sometimes shows up in the first decade of life , but it can be very confusing for parents because it is quite normative for children to act in a cross-gender play and way , and that in fact there are studies that show that even 80 percent of children who act in that fashion will not persist in wanting to be the opposite gender at the time when puberty begins .
and indeed , the rate of suicide among untreated transgendered people is among the highest in the world .
it became the first program of its kind -- but it &apos;s really of the dutch kind -- in north america .
so this picture , i think , says it all .
thank you .
so let &apos;s start with the data .
in tanzania and uganda , they represent 90 percent of coke &apos;s sales .
so even though it &apos;s a global company , they take a very local approach .
well , you work with the community .
let &apos;s look at a country like india .
so by next summer , we &apos;re sighted to run out of money on polio .
i &apos;m going to fly you into five research projects in the allosphere that are going to take you from biological macroscopic data all the way down to electron spin .
what you &apos;re seeing here right now is a superposition of an electron in the lower three orbitals of a hydrogen atom .
and in my nature , i guess , i am a doer of things more than i am a spectator or a contemplator of things , and it &apos;s that dichotomy , the gulf between ideas and action that i &apos;m going to try and explore briefly .
no one had ever done this . i was 26 at the time .
i can &apos;t explain quite how good it is until you &apos;ve tried it , but it has the capacity to burn up all the money i can get my hands on , to ruin every relationship i &apos;ve ever had , so be careful what you wish for .
and yet , if i &apos;ve learned anything in nearly 12 years now of dragging heavy things around cold places , it is that true , real inspiration and growth only comes from adversity and from challenge , from stepping away from what &apos;s comfortable and familiar and stepping out into the unknown .
well this is a sagittal slice through me .
so it really is great .
and it was a mirror image because in the real world we always look down on plans , plans of houses or streets or maps .
but most r and d is going to be institutionally funded , by the polish academy of sciences or the engineering and physical sciences research council or whatever , and you need to get past those people .
the good news is the benefits are stonkingly huge .
but i still think that this -- -- may be this year &apos;s version of this .
the current health crisis , however , is a little more the work of the evil empire .
now , don &apos;t get me wrong .
there was no snack food , and until the &apos; 20s , until clarence birdseye came along , there was no frozen food .
now , i know everybody over the age of , like 45 -- their mouths are watering at this point .
by the &apos; 70s , forward-thinking people began to recognize the value of local ingredients .
can farm-raised salmon be organic , when its feed has nothing to do with its natural diet , even if the feed itself is supposedly organic , and the fish themselves are packed tightly in pens , swimming in their own filth ?
some of us might think that would be a good thing .
so we &apos;re starting with a variety of technologies that have converged into these conversational character robots that can see faces , make eye contact with you , make a full range of facial expressions , understand speech and begin to model how you &apos;re feeling and who you are , and build a relationship with you .
so , we &apos;ve made 20 robots in the last eight years , during the course of getting my ph.d .
when the kids arrive they &apos;re confronted with lots of stuff : wood and nails and rope and wheels , and lots of tools , real tools .
wake up .
so when i was contacted by the parks department about a $ 10,000 seed grant initiative seed grant initiative to help develop waterfront projects , i thought they were really well-meaning , but a bit naive .
well , first of all , we &apos;re all incredibly good-looking -- -- graduated high school , college , post-graduate degrees , traveled to interesting places , didn &apos;t have kids in your early teens , financially stable , never been imprisoned . ok .
now , why is this story important ?
anyway -- ok . katrina . prior to katrina , the south bronx and new orleans &apos; ninth ward had a lot in common . both were largely populated by poor people of color , both hotbeds of cultural innovation : think hip-hop and jazz .
there &apos;s enough precedent out there to show that a sustainable , community-friendly development can still make a fortune .
of the 90 percent of the energy that mr. gore reminded us that we waste every day , don &apos;t add wasting our energy , intelligence and hard-earned experience to that count .
so you can take a bacteria that really doesn &apos;t make these things at all , and if you could clamp these on it really well you have it taken off the street .
why did they not die ?
and of course , there &apos;s been economic growth in the west .
this is what we will find there .
can you see the poorest billion , those &#91; two &#93; boxes i had over here ?
i would love to share with you a story .
the art of storytelling has remained unchanged .
you want a cigarette in prison ? three to five dollars .
this is coal , the most common source of electricity on the planet , and there &apos;s enough energy in this coal to light this bulb for more than a year .
but we &apos;re just one company , and this is just scratching the surface .
&lt; speaker &gt; miwa matreyek &lt; / speaker &gt;
they orient to the caregiver .
so something that in other species are survival mechanisms , without them they wouldn &apos;t basically live , we bring into the context of human beings , and this is what we need to simply act , act socially .
were we to be able to identify this condition at an earlier point , and intervene and treat , i can tell you , and this has been probably something that has changed my life in the past 10 years , this notion that we can absolutely attenuate this condition .
what we want is to embrace that world and bring it into our laboratory , but in order for us to do that , we had to create these very sophisticated measures , measures of how people , how little babies , how newborns , engage with the world , moment by moment , what is important , and what is not .
we didn &apos;t have to wait for the behaviors of autism to emerge in the second year of life .
so , basically we have public leaders , public officials who are out of control ; they are writing bills that are unintelligible , and out of these bills are going to come maybe 40,000 pages of regulations , total complexity , which has a dramatically negative impact on our life .
they have been tested in the laboratory .
and they would look that up .
they bring the medicines up from the pharmacy .
you wouldn &apos;t want to do this with a current industrial robot .
now she &apos;s got the robot doing it .
i mean robots doing the things that we normally do for ourselves but get harder as we get older .
without this ability there is no magic .
they want to share the experience .
tell your kids . &quot; ) it all sort of started as a benign mistake , like penicillin .
so the hepburn story is words and the dietrich story is pictures , and so we did this .
that &apos;s a responsibility .
and the guy behind the counter said , &quot; i know , lady . they all came in that way . &quot;
then he &apos;d run his hand over the rag paper , and the pungent ink and the deckled edges of the pages .
phyllis rodriguez : we are here today because of the fact that we have what most people consider an unusual friendship .
i lost a child when i was 15 , a second child when i was 16 .
but she reached out to us in that way , and it was , i &apos;d like to say , it was an ice-breaker .
cruelty : i knew that the 10 billion animals we raise each year for meat are raised in factory farm conditions that we , hypocritically , wouldn &apos;t even consider for our own cats , dogs and other pets .
it &apos;s structured , so it ends up being simple to remember , and it &apos;s okay to break it here and there .
and i found one section amongst all of these that actually resembled the outline of the united states of america , which you can see here .
this is the only federally funded site where it is legal to cultivate cannabis for scientific research in the united states .
this is the death star .
i traveled across the united states photographing men and women who had been wrongfully convicted of crimes they did not commit , violent crimes .
i photographed ron at a baseball field because he had been drafted to the oakland a &apos;s to play professional baseball just before his conviction .
and they project and connect to different brain regions , and they also change different ways in different disease states .
and for parkinson &apos;s disease , cochlear implants , these have indeed been able to bring some kind of remedy to people with certain kinds of disorder .
and early in the morning one day in the summer of 2004 , we gave it a try , and it worked on the first try .
these are the dopamine neurons , which some of you may have heard about , in some of the pleasure centers in the brain .
now over the last couple of years , we &apos;ve gone back to the tree of life because we wanted to find ways to turn circuits in the brain off .
now there are many forms of blindness where the photoreceptors , our light sensors that are in the back of our eye , are gone .
so this mouse was blind a couple weeks before this experiment and received one dose of this photosensitive molecule in a virus .
paragliding is taking off from mountains with a paraglider , with the possibility to fly cross-country , distance , just with the use of thermals to soar .
two years after this , i was the first to base jump from matterhorn , a very famous mountain that probably everybody knows in here .
ueli gegenschatz : pretty much . i believe this is probably the closest possibility to come to the dream of being able to fly .
ue : thank you very much .
this is a library in auckland .
we sign , and there &apos;s all this hype leading up to our next record .
and a lot of artists have a problem with this .
the two most likely largest inventions of our generation are the internet and the mobile phone .
right ?
one way is to sabotage encryption algorithms , which is a great example about how u.s. intelligence agencies are running loose .
what the hell ?
yes , part of it is war on terror , and yes , there are terrorists , and they do kill and maim , and we should fight them , but we know through these leaks that they have used the same techniques to listen to phone calls of european leaders , to tap the email of residents of mexico and brazil , to read email traffic inside the united nations headquarters and e.u. parliament , and i don &apos;t think they are trying to find terrorists from inside the e.u. parliament , right ?
and this is all the kind of information we are giving away , we are giving away to the united states .
it only has to solve one little problem .
now in the meantime , i have six friends who are waiting at the next six consecutive stops in their underwear as well .
and we &apos;ve continued to do it every year .
and because it was in union square park , right by a subway station , there were hundreds of people by the end who stopped and looked up and watched what we were doing .
you can see them in this footage .
so there &apos;s a photograph that illustrates it a little bit better .
for 11 years , i was mayor of tirana , our capital .
to the first question , 63 percent of people said yes , we like it .
but people were waiting in long queues under sun and under rain in order to get a certificate or just a simple answer from two tiny windows of two metal kiosks .
this is politics , not from top down , but from the bottom up , and sideways , and allowing everybody &apos;s voice to be heard is exactly what we need .
one is computation ; this is the stuff you &apos;ve forgotten .
i believe in real life .
and then and only then , we throw down that mathematical structure .
it &apos;s tedious .
i put this problem on my blog recently : in a grocery store , which line do you get into , the one that has one cart and 19 items or the line with four carts and three , five , two and one items .
so we often are presented with the kind of words like that the private sector is also much more innovative because it &apos;s able to think out of the box .
these are the very smart , revolutionary bits about the iphone , and they &apos;re all government-funded .
the nanotechnology sector is actually fascinating to study this , because the word itself , nanotechnology , came from within government .
okay , it &apos;s not true because many of the jobs that are created go abroad .
and it &apos;s not completely gratuitous , because wok and roll -- chinese food and japanese foods , so it kind of works out .
so , the interesting question is , how do you go from fortune cookies being something that is japanese to being something that is chinese ?
and then they &apos;re like , is this chinese food ?
this is actually in the library of congress ; it is a pamphlet published by samuel gompers , hero of our american labor movement , and it &apos;s called , &quot; some reason for chinese exclusion : meat versus rice : american manhood against asiatic coolieism : which shall survive ?
so , there &apos;s peruvian chinese food , which should not be mixed with mexican chinese food , where they basically take things and make it look like fajitas .
you know , there are a bunch of them , including lee &apos;s china in omaha -- which is actually run by koreans , but that &apos;s another point -- and a bunch of them named china buffet .
so . thank you very much .
my mother had to do a lot of explaining , telling people that her son did not commit a premeditated arson .
each fiber in the wood has its own reason and function for being , and only through cooperation and harmony among them comes a great bow .
now , one of the non-perks of being a lexicographer is that people don &apos;t usually have a kind of warm , fuzzy , snuggly image of the dictionary .
i mean , i &apos;m a huge geek , i love computers .
she goes to cut the butt off the ham and throw it away , and she looks at this piece of ham and she &apos;s like , &quot; this is a perfectly good piece of ham . why am i throwing this away ? &quot;
the book-shaped dictionary is not going to be the only shape dictionaries come in . and it &apos;s not going to be the prototype for the shapes dictionaries come in .
library of congress : 17 million books , of which half are in english .
we don &apos;t even see that there &apos;s a gap on the map .
so a word without its source is like a cut flower .
angela belcher : using nature to grow batteries
also , when we think about future technologies , we start with the beginning of earth .
and so i give this out to thousands of people .
and so the other thing that &apos;s beautiful about biology is that biology gives you really exquisite structures with nice link scales .
through evolution and selection , we took it from an eight percent efficiency solar cell to an 11 percent efficiency solar cell .
and i &apos;ll just give you one example . i had gotten my first walkman .
now , what i took away from the exhibit was that maybe with the exception of the mandala most of the pieces in there were actually about the visualization of happiness and not about happiness .
and also gave this fake letter from the mta to everybody -- sort of like pretending that it &apos;s an art project financed by the metropolitan transit authority .
you know , one is : just working without pressure .
then it &apos;s &quot; for , &quot; with the light on .
and six months later , we sat down at kennedy space center .
he was so happy .
they collectively represent every one of 86 occupational categories and hail from over 80 countries .
well , one fact that we can take advantage of , i think a fact you &apos;ll all agree is true , is that time goes forward , not backward . right ? the cause has to come before the effect .
he just needed someone helping him .
&quot; i don &apos;t need your help , &quot; he said .
thousands of passionate volunteers who will leave everything they do and run to help people they don &apos;t even know .
and he saved my father .
the world health organization estimates -- well , they make various estimates of the number of people who need glasses -- the lowest estimate is 150 million people .
in fact , this technology &apos;s been evolving .
when i travel with my work across europe and the united states , one question always comes up : where is the palestinian gandhi ?
israeli activist : i was sure we were all going to die .
so they kept on going .
and when i talk about it i usually pick business because they make the best pictures that you can put in your presentation , and because it &apos;s the easiest sort of way to keep score .
now there are magazines about water .
people are paying full price for both , and the only thing they have in common is that they don &apos;t have anything in common .
smooth out the edges ; go for the center ; that &apos;s the big market .
it &apos;s as loud as a 747 jet . you can &apos;t get in the car ; it &apos;s got bulletproof glass on the windows because they &apos;ll blow out the windshield otherwise .
fastest-growing business in the whole mortuary industry .
and my big failure ? i came out with an entire record album and hopefully a whole bunch of record albums in sacd format -- this remarkable new format -- and i marketed it straight to people with 20,000-dollar stereos .
my work , for a long time , has been involved in education , in teaching people practical skills for sustainability , teaching people how to take responsibility for growing some of their own food , how to build buildings using local materials , how to generate their own energy , and so on .
but are we to assume that the same brilliance and creativity and adaptability that got us up to the top of that energy mountain in the first place is somehow mysteriously going to evaporate when we have to design a creative way back down the other side ?
and in terms of climate change , is something that is not actually feasible .
and it feels historic . it tries to create a sense that this is a historic opportunity to do something really extraordinary .
and actually a lot of them are doing huge amounts of stuff .
there are now two local authorities in this country who have declared themselves transitional local authorities , leicestershire and somerset . and in stroud , the transition group there , in effect , wrote the local government &apos;s food plan .
well , one or two brave souls .
&quot; oh yeah , by sharing needles . &quot;
we &apos;ve got what &apos;s rational for public health .
i don &apos;t know if pope benedict watches tedtalks online , but if you do , i &apos;ve got news for you benedict -- i carry condoms all the time and i never get laid .
what &apos;s rational for public health is also rational for individual sex workers because it &apos;s really bad for business to have another sti .
that &apos;s simply not necessarily true , and i think we can learn a lot from the experience of gay men in rich countries where treatment has been widely available for going on 15 years now .
this is what factory workers earn in an hour in indonesia : on average , 20 cents .
and i &apos;m going to talk about some of those consequences and just present a whole bunch of really interesting projects that i think give us tremendous reasons to be really optimistic that the big design and development project of the next 50 years is going to be retrofitting suburbia .
but that they &apos;re really all market driven , and what &apos;s driving the market in particular -- number one -- is major demographic shifts .
this was a little grocery store , a food lion grocery store , that is now a public library .
eventually , i expect that the streets will probably extend through a redevelopment of the mall .
and so it &apos;s giving people more choices , but it &apos;s not taking away choices .
the first is to plan retrofitting much more systemically at the metropolitan scale .
but culturally , we tend to think that downtowns should be dynamic , and we expect that .
i think there &apos;s an assumption amongst most people in the public that if a mother is hiv-positive , she &apos;s going to infect her child .
well , back in 2001 , when there was just a simple test and a single dose of a drug , a nurse , in the course of her few minutes with a patient , would have to counsel for the hiv test , perform the hiv test , explain the results , dispense a single dose of the drug , nevirapine , explain how to take it , discuss infant feeding options , reinforce infant feeding , and test the baby -- in minutes .
have a seat . you &apos;re safe here .
the father and the mother , together , they get the results .
and the issue in africa is that there are fewer nurses , really than doctors , and so we need to find new paradigm for health care .
every year in the united states alone , 2,077,000 couples make a legal and spiritual decision to spend the rest of their lives together ...
it &apos;s obvious that this leads to marital bliss because , women , we care a great deal about being thin and good looking , whereas men mostly care about sex ...
do not win an oscar for best actress .
so we have to keep an eye on that .
it would say you &apos;re wrong most of the time .
it &apos;s a four-letter word . it &apos;s a kind of a bad feeling word , fear .
this was a square that responds to sound .
so that was 20 years ago , and i was always on the periphery of art .
but i found a sign for russian-speaking people , and it was the best sign ever to say no .
so what this is , is a kind of a sketch , an application sketch i wrote in python . you know how there &apos;s photoshop ?
but it &apos;s imperative that we listen because it &apos;s undeniable and definitive .
the first level , the weakest level of civil response against violence , is denial and apathy .
they say , &quot; i can &apos;t take it anymore .
and for over a year he has known that a price has been put on his head .
the battle is won , but we still have to fight it .
and i &apos;m also being told that the drum is without snares .
and so on . there is a little bit of a difference there that is worth just -- -- thinking about .
and every single entry had to be listened to , experienced and then based on the musical ability -- then that person could either enter or not .
the tiniest , softest , softest sound to something that is so broad , so huge , so incredible ! there &apos;s always something -- it may sound good up there , may not be so good there .
try again . snow .
we had to study from study books .
or , more specifically , what we learned from the creation of a very large and complicated machine for a music video .
the machine itself would start the music .
you know , we spent a lot of time ideating and even building some of these things .
let me start again .
but while our instrument was being built , i became involved in calculations of the greenhouse effect here on earth , because we realized that our atmospheric composition was changing .
soon the first line of the mission statement was deleted , never to appear again .
careful examination shows that the temperature changes slightly lead the co2 changes by a few centuries .
in recent years , because of global warming , they now cover about 10 percent -- an increase by a factor of 25 to 50 .
i need your help to communicate the gravity and the urgency of this situation and its solutions more effectively .
they felt science had stagnated since the days of the scientific revolution that had happened in the 17th century .
it was capable of iteration , conditional branching and parallel processing , and it was programmable using punched cards , an idea babbage took from jacquard &apos;s loom .
&lt; reviewer href = &quot; http : / / www.ted.com / profiles / 1108408 &quot; &gt; morton bast &lt; / reviewer &gt;
as we were talking , roman told us that he &apos;s kind of an inventor on the side .
so we set up a quick experiment here to show that to you .
and hold onto this . good luck to you .
while he was doing this , he noticed an unexpected thing .
zk : now , this technology was developed by these two guys : professor ken suslick and neil rakow , of the university of illinois .
rose george : let &apos;s talk crap . seriously .
this is marie saylee , nine months old .
twenty-five percent of girls in india drop out of school because they have no adequate sanitation .
so you &apos;d be thinking by now , okay , the solution &apos;s simple , we give everyone a toilet .
it &apos;s what i call social contagion , and it &apos;s really powerful and really exciting .
the solution to all of this is pretty easy .
i was concerned about making a place for the study of law .
i did this building in japan .
we made the drawings of the fish and the scales .
he was a souvenir salesman who always wanted to be a painter , and i was frankie p. toronto .
and it seemed to work as a way to put he and i together .
so it &apos;s out in the middle of nowhere , and you approach it .
and so then i put this big billboard behind it .
and we started with the stream and built the house along the stream -- dammed it up to make a lake .
in this case we learned how to detail it .
and she came back , i guess wealthier or something -- something happened -- and asked me to design a house for her on this site .
you come down from this level along the stairway , and you enter the bedroom here , going into the lake .
palais des sports , the gare de lyon over here .
i don &apos;t know what to do .
it &apos;s plaster and just zinc .
these were the three buildings that were the ideal -- the concertgebouw , boston and berlin .
and i was asked to do a fish , and so i did a snake .
and in some countries -- let me pick afghanistan -- 75 percent of the little girls don &apos;t go to school .
so now , in closing , people say , now why laptops ?
in the south , in the northeast , almost everywhere but with a couple of exceptions here and there .
so you see big differences in different parts of the country on this question .
we can see in different types of communities that the results are quite different .
and you interact a lot with your neighbors -- people you like , people you might not know .
it &apos;s in the eye of the beholder .
now , keeping these ideas firmly in mind , we can say that the experience of beauty is one of the ways that evolution has of arousing and sustaining interest or fascination , even obsession , in order to encourage us toward making the most adaptive decisions for survival and reproduction .
these acheulian hand axes -- they &apos;re named after st. acheul in france , where finds were made in 19th century -- have been unearthed in their thousands , scattered across asia , europe and africa , almost everywhere homo erectus and homo ergaster roamed .
it &apos;s a gift handed down from the intelligent skills and rich emotional lives of our most ancient ancestors .
now there are three things i want you to see now that i &apos;ve described lesterland .
the united states is worse than lesterland , worse than lesterland because you can imagine in lesterland if we lesters got a letter from the government that said , &quot; hey , you get to pick who gets to run in the general election , &quot; we would think maybe of a kind of aristocracy of lesters .
it works against the left and the right , and that , you might say , is good news .
if the problem is members spending an extraordinary amount of time fundraising from the tiniest slice of america , the solution is to have them spend less time fundraising but fundraise from a wider slice of americans , to spread it out , to spread the funder influence so that we restore the idea of dependence upon the people alone .
and what hit me was an image of my six-year-old son .
so let &apos;s start off looking at something rather not-so-small , something that we can see with our naked eye , and that &apos;s a bee . so when you look at this bee , it &apos;s about this size here , it &apos;s about a centimeter .
it wouldn &apos;t look or feel like anything that we see when we look at a flower . so if you look at this flower here , and you &apos;re a little bug , if you &apos;re on that surface of that flower , that &apos;s what the terrain would look like .
so when i first looked at this , i was -- i thought , gee , this is like a little treasure trove here .
now , the moon has no atmosphere , so micrometeorites come in continuously , and the whole surface of the moon is covered with powder now , because for four billion years it &apos;s been bombarded by micrometeorites , and when micrometeorites come in at about 20 to 60,000 miles an hour , they vaporize on contact .
i needed some way to share the experience directly .
but it was worth it , because we caught it in a special capture device , brought it up into the lab on the ship , and then everything on this fish lights up .
so if you brush up against it , any place you brushed against it , you get this twinkling blue-green light that &apos;s just breathtaking .
so there &apos;s a language of light in the deep ocean , and we &apos;re just beginning to understand it , and one way we &apos;re going about that is we &apos;re imitating a lot of these displays .
and it does actually seem to be trying to eat the electronic jellyfish .
thank you .
i &apos;ve had some time to think it over .
add that together with the gas , and it &apos;s $ 112,000 per year , just for that sign in each direction .
so , now that you are all &quot; road scholars &quot; ...
so i decided that i would start to draw . how hard could that be ?
and what you have to do is , you really have to edit down to what you want to say .
and it really became the -- i don &apos;t know , you know , it was one of those moments people started laughing at what was going on .
so , there &apos;s a kind of british understatement , murder-mystery theme that i really love very much .
maybe amongst themselves they had a few good laughs , but stalin was a paranoid man , even more than my father . &quot;
there &apos;s consoling .
and she dated george gershwin , so , you know , get out .
this is oliver medvedik . he &apos;s not a vending machine , but he is one of the founders of genspace , a community biolab in brooklyn , new york , where anybody can go and take classes and learn how to do things like grow e. coli that glows in the dark or learn how to take strawberry dna .
but that made me think about collecting toys , and this thing that &apos;s going on right now in the toy world with blind box toys , and being able to collect these rare toys .
my late , lamented friend bob nozick , a fine philosopher , in one of his books , &quot; philosophical explanations , &quot; is commenting on the ethos of philosophy -- the way philosophers go about their business .
that &apos;s supposed to exhibit the stream of consciousness .
this means that a lot of people are just left completely dissatisfied and incredulous when i attempt to explain consciousness .
ok , now , you all saw what changed , right ?
and i thought as i got closer i would be able to see all the detail of most people , see their clothes , and so forth .
how do you know that &apos;s what you did ?
we don &apos;t have any trouble seeing the cube , but where does the color change ?
can you see that one ?
thank you very much .
it was incredibly successful .
but the fact is , people are mostly focused on defending the computers on the internet , and there &apos;s been surprisingly little attention to defending the internet itself as a communications medium .
and the problem with it is , i think we are setting ourselves up for a kind of disaster like the disaster we had in the financial system , where we take a system that &apos;s basically built on trust , was basically built for a smaller-scale system , and we &apos;ve kind of expanded it way beyond the limits of how it was meant to operate .
in other countries , new drugs are not being reimbursed , and therefore don &apos;t reach patients .
so going the hospital is a lottery .
so many unnecessary surgeries , and so much unnecessary suffering for all the patients who were operated on in that seven year period .
it stands for the international consortium for health outcome measurement .
but actually , it &apos;s not my fault ; it &apos;s from the guardian newspaper .
what &apos;s beautiful is , you can probably see on the limb there some faint , sort of , wisps of almost smoke rising up from the limb .
tremendous and beautiful discovery .
now that led to an understanding of atomic structure because the way that &apos;s explained is atoms are a single nucleus with electrons going around them .
well , this is a picture of it .
it can be beautiful . it can reveal quite astonishing things .
he said , &quot; consider again that dot .
and with all of our modern telescopes , we &apos;ve been able to collect this stunning silent movie of the universe -- these series of snapshots that go all the way back to the big bang .
it wasn &apos;t einstein who realized this , it was karl schwarzschild who was a german jew in world war i -- joined the german army already an accomplished scientist , working on the russian front .
but what &apos;s very impressive is that , from our vantage point , we can always see the earth .
and they travel out into the cosmos at the speed of light .
want to get away from the sound .
it might make a sound .
i mean we have to ask , has it happened before ?
but i took a deep breath , and i signed up to play , and i felt pretty good .
by having a song that explained what was happening to me , while it was happening , that gave the audience permission to think about it .
now having seen that -- and i &apos;ve seen it hundreds of times , because i use this in every talk i give -- i still can &apos;t see that they &apos;re the same size and shape , and i doubt that you can either .
so the roslings have been able to do simplicity without removing what &apos;s important about the data .
and so six-year-old lauren there noticed that the first one took one , and the second one took three more and the total was four on that one , the third one took five more and the total was nine on that one , and then the next one .
if i turn this wheel , you can see that number over there going minus and positive .
we get one child like that about every classroom of 30 kids who will actually cut straight to the chase .
it sounds like a lot , but it is literally 18 minutes of what we &apos;re spending in iraq -- we &apos;re spending 8 billion dollars a month ; 18 minutes is 100 million dollars -- so this is actually cheap .
one , two , three .
&quot; could my doctor have warned me ? &quot;
now , i &apos;m going to take you on a little journey here .
look at the kind of data that &apos;s available .
this might be what we end up with .
&lt; speaker &gt; gary wolf &lt; / speaker &gt;
it &apos;s really just a pressure sensor like the kind that &apos;s in a doorbell .
jr : my wish : use art to turn the world inside out
and i framed it with color so you would not confuse it with advertising .
so i took full portraits of people from le bosquet .
we did face 2 face with only six friends , two ladders , two brushes , a rented car , a camera and 20,000 square feet of paper .
when i listened to all the stories everywhere i went on the continents , i couldn &apos;t always understand the complicated circumstances of their conflict .
they were all linked to the three kids that got killed .
we went to africa , sudan , sierra leone , liberia , kenya .
okay , india .
but to get it , they would have to &#91; get &#93; it signed by one of the women .
in each place , we built exhibitions with a story , and the story traveled .
take the photos , the portraits , upload it -- i &apos;ll give you all the details -- and i &apos;ll send you back your poster . join by groups and reveal things to the world .
after about three days , the bubbles will appear on the surface of the liquid .
and because of the super-absorbency of this kind of cellulose , it just takes one , and a really short one at that .
jon nguyen : tour the solar system from home
you can see , there &apos;s saturn , there &apos;s jupiter , and while we &apos;re here , i want to point out something .
it actually has a very thick atmosphere .
quixotic fusion : dancing with light
the ground stations are located on safe locations on the ground .
if it is a new paradigm , though , there must be other uses for it .
the earth spins , of course , as it travels around the sun , so the earth bulges a little bit around the middle , like some earthlings .
this is the only place you can go nowadays and not get &quot; friended . &quot;
sympathetic magic is imitation .
you return to where you started .
and it &apos;s technological , so it can do things like microelectronics , and maybe photonics do .
and so what does that mean ?
and the gears work in water as well .
and we stored penicillin at 60 degrees c , so 140 degrees fahrenheit , for two months without loss of efficacy of the penicillin .
what most people don &apos;t realize is that hunger and energy use are controlled by the brain , mostly without your awareness .
in our modern world of drive-thru burgers , it &apos;s not working out so well for many of us .
if you think about this , the typical outcome of dieting is that you &apos;re more likely to gain weight in the long run than to lose it .
i think most of them would be happier and healthier , and as adults , many of them would probably be thinner .
beam me up , scotty .
you can &apos;t see how different your search results are from anyone else &apos;s .
what they discovered was that in our netflix queues there &apos;s this epic struggle going on between our future aspirational selves and our more impulsive present selves .
and we need you to give us some control so that we can decide what gets through and what doesn &apos;t .
the idea is that instead of figuring out how to ameliorate symptoms with devices and drugs and the like -- and i &apos;ll come back to that theme a few times -- instead of doing that , we will regenerate lost function of the body by regenerating the function of organs and damaged tissue .
and you can see that right around age 45 , 40 to 45 , there &apos;s a sudden spike in the cost of health care .
i &apos;ll actually show you some more important features about limb regeneration in a moment .
and that idea was that the small intestine of a pig , if you threw away all the cells , and if you did that in a way that allowed it to remain biologically active , may contain all of the necessary factors and signals that would signal the body to heal itself .
here &apos;s a dolphin where the fin &apos;s been re-attached .
you see the cells coming back out .
we have a very abiding and heartbreaking partnership with our colleagues at the institute for surgical research in the us army , who have to treat the now 11,000 kids that have come back from iraq .
in the united states we &apos;ve had a somewhat different approach .
trust me on that one .
the entire pile is my stuff if i &apos;m building something .
plastics are a whole other story : well less than 10 percent are recovered .
they store the plastics on the roofs .
they get to close the loop with their products .
so i hope i &apos;ve changed the way you look at at least some of the stuff in your life .
this is a victory of thousands of users , in hundreds of cities , one user , one edit at a time .
and so a few years ago -- fours years ago , actually -- i set out to say , is there a way we can communicate science and technique and wonder ?
so you can lavish all the same care , all the same technique , on a hamburger as you would on some much more fancy dish .
and so those coals that kept falling off the edge , we kept having to put them back up .
and it &apos;s got this funny horn-shaped thing , which as far as i know , again , the first cookbook to ever do this .
now the amazing thing here is that a ballistics gelatin is supposed to mimic what happens to human flesh when you get shot -- that &apos;s why you shouldn &apos;t get shot .
now this was revolutionary .
we want this number to emerge from the laws of physics , but so far no one has found a way to do that .
now when these ideas were first developed , there were only about five different candidate shapes , so you can imagine analyzing them one-by-one to determine if any yield the physical features we observe .
and he worked for decades trying to explain this number , but he never succeeded , and we know why .
each of these universes has extra dimensions .
brian , thank you .
that was his passion for the music .
and in the 21st century ...
mtt : this , of course , was the birth of opera , and its development put music on a radical new course .
and to me that &apos;s the most essential of all .
follow traces . get lost . be surprised , amused inspired .
well , in order for a clinical trial to generate valid and widely applicable results , they need to be conducted with large numbers of study participants and preferably on a population with a high incidence of new hiv infections .
if , for any reason , they feel that this might not be possible , then i think they should have to ethically justify why the clinical trial should be conducted in the first place .
when we learn of tribal practices , some of them will horrify us , but there are other tribal practices which , when we hear about them , we may admire and envy and wonder whether we could adopt those practices ourselves .
in contrast , in traditional societies without writing , older people are the repositories of information .
we americans move on the average every five years .
unfortunately , all of those terrible situations could come back .
those are just some examples of what we can learn from traditional societies .
but i learned it &apos;s nearly impossible to create a new hybrid mushroom .
thank you .
samuel pisar , an auschwitz survivor , said , and i &apos;ll quote him , &quot; the holocaust teaches us that nature , even in its cruelest moments , is benign in comparison with man , when he loses his moral compass and his reason . &quot;
after all the tense moments of conflict in all the conflict zones of the world , there &apos;s one photograph from a much quieter place that haunts me still , much more than the others .
but in her office , there &apos;s this old wooden , weather-worn table , kitchen table -- peeling green paint , it &apos;s kind of rickety .
her answer set the template for the entire career i was to have after that .
and you know , she had that old-school teacher stare .
and it has four plexiglass layers .
stewart brand is here , and one of the ideas for this game came from him with a coevolution quarterly article on a peace force .
so i &apos;ll just share with you some stories very quickly of some magical things that have happened .
if you &apos;re a military commander and you wage troops -- the little plastic toys on the board -- and you lose them , i put in a letter .
and i can &apos;t design that , i can &apos;t plan that , and i can &apos;t even test that .
principal walks in , i &apos;m out of a job .
and i have a dream .
and indeed , we were so successful at producing certain types of stuff that we destroyed a lot of europe , and we had to rebuild it afterwards .
and economics is very interested in scarcity .
they &apos;re latin american .
that &apos;s one way of looking at it .
you put a smart meter in your home , and you see how much electricity you &apos;re using right now , how much it &apos;s costing you , your kids go around and turn the lights off pretty quickly .
the fourth is keep learning and keep is important -- learning throughout the whole life course .
iranian-born artist shirin neshat explores the paradox of being an artist in exile : a voice for her people , but unable to go home . in her work , she explores iran pre- and post-islamic revolution , tracing political and societal change through powerful images of women .
i did not start to make social commentary about my country .
this film also speaks to the iranian people in asking them to return to their history and look at themselves before they were so islamicized -- in the way we looked , in the way we played music , in the way we had intellectual life .
i want to start with a game .
now , can any of you see the predator that &apos;s about to jump out at you ?
and what &apos;s true for sensory information is true for information generally .
and we &apos;re going to look at that for about 30 seconds , which is a bit of a killer in an 18-minute talk .
why ? because if the tile in that shadow were in fact in shadow , and reflecting the same amount of light to your eye as the one outside the shadow , it would have to be more reflective -- just the laws of physics .
keep blinking . every time you blink it will switch . alright ?
so they copy each other . they can count to five . they can recognize faces .
and then we just simply translate that into sound .
all right . now you can see that changes the light that &apos;s coming through there . right ?
so they came to me -- cnn -- and they said , &quot; professor seligman , would you tell us about the state of psychology today ?
and what was good about psychology , about the 30 billion dollar investment nimh made , about working in the disease model , about what you mean by psychology , is that , 60 years ago , none of the disorders were treatable -- it was entirely smoke and mirrors .
you can ask , how do you stack up for positive emotion , for meaning , for flow , against literally tens of thousands of other people ?
and third , the meaningful life .
when he walks onto the floor of the american exchange at 9 : 30 in the morning , time stops for him . and it stops till the closing bell .
i mentioned that for all three kinds of lives , the pleasant life , the good life , the meaningful life , people are now hard at work on the question , are there things that lastingly change those lives ?
and our results surprised us , but they were backward of what we thought .
as laura lee told us , design , and , i believe , entertainment and technology , can be used to increase meaning engagement in life as well .
and so i want to do a little demo for you .
we &apos;ve had a mom in utah who used them with her kids , to a science researcher in the u.k. , and curriculum developers in hawaii .
and he turned to me , and he said , &quot; put her there ! &quot;
how do we solve these three problems that i &apos;d like to mention ?
the problem is the person or persons using it .
that &apos;s what she &apos;s really interested in . &quot;
we see people on our screens .
a few years ago , a university student asked me , &quot; what is the greatest surprise in your life ? &quot;
pascal saw us as a remarkable mixture of genius and self-delusion .
i &apos;m the embodiment of all truth . &quot;
i have been living and teaching in the gulf for over 30 years .
would he need the same language as a lawyer , for example ?
he , by the way , was considered remedial at school because he was , in fact , dyslexic .
and she was the best in the class at those subjects .
however , it &apos;s hard sometimes to remember the extent of that urbanization .
when you can get rid of all of those because somebody doesn &apos;t use any of them really , you find that you can actually cut transportation emissions as much as 90 percent .
we cool them with breezes . we heat them with sunshine .
&quot; lucky for you he calls at all , &quot; said jasmine .
so the girls thought for a moment , and one girl suggested , &quot; why don &apos;t we just take the dance in the jail ? &quot;
dennis vanengelsdorp : a plea for bees
if we lost one in every three cows in the winter , you know , the national guard would be out .
and he has a history of these trucks , and he &apos;s moved these bees up and down the coast .
it &apos;s said that for bees , the flower is the fountain of life , and for flowers bees are the messengers of love .
and so , in fact , if you know you have these kleptoparasitic bees , you know that your environment is healthy , because they &apos;re top-of-the-food-chain bees .
and so we need to rethink this idea .
can opera be ever-so-slightly sexy ? the glorious soprano danielle de niese shows how , singing the flirty &quot; meine lippen , sie küssen so heiss . &quot; which , translated , means , as you might guess : &quot; i kiss so hot . &quot; from giuditta by frans lehár ; accompanist : ingrid surgenor .
to be strong means not to be a girl .
i want to say that i think the powers that be know that empire-building is actually -- that feelings get in the way of empire-building .
we silence them . we make them feel guilty for being smart . we get them to behave , to tone it down , not to be too intense .
and she was holding her baby .
she &apos;s changed the rules .
and what she said to him was , &quot; you were willing to sell me for four cows , and a calf and some blankets .
i can feel the invisible stirrings in the air .
i am an emotional creature .
they worked until four o &apos;clock in the morning .
on that very day , december 10 , 1996 while mr. four in the morning , faron young , was giving up the ghost in nashville , tennessee , ms. four in the morning -- or one of them anyway -- wislawa szymborska was in stockholm , sweden , accepting the nobel prize for literature .
it had gotten a lot better since 4 a.m. &quot;
and it was von neumann who said , after the bomb , he was working on something much more important than bombs : he &apos;s thinking about computers .
if you look at the origins of this , the classic history sort of takes it all back to the eniac here .
they were real soldering-gun type guys , and they actually built this thing .
that &apos;s an engineer gazing at tube number 36 , trying to figure out why the memory &apos;s not in focus .
&quot; picked a lightning bug off the drum . &quot; &quot; running at two kilocycles . &quot;
and he saw everything in terms of -- he could read the binary code straight off the machine .
and could you do it again now ?
and it &apos;s julian bigelow who was running it until midnight when the machine was officially turned off .
and third of all , it &apos;s so sharp , it just cuts .
it was third .
still can &apos;t reach it .
or the 1963 jaguar : it &apos;s actually a crummy car , falls apart all the time , but the owners love it .
and that means the tea is partially covered while it completes the brewing .
as opposed to this one , which is a pure behavioral watch , which probably keeps better time than the $ 13,000 watch i just showed you .
ok , the gentleman on the left is saying , &quot; screw you , i &apos;m going to check my device . &quot;
thank you .
i wouldn &apos;t have been able to convey so little information .
if that subtly nudges you to feel about them identically , that &apos;s going to make it easier to save .
if you do , would you mind if i timed how long it took you to walk down that hallway ?
it &apos;s current pleasure in exchange for future pain .
so i want to pick up from there because i only had 18 minutes , frankly .
and human resources are like natural resources ; they &apos;re often buried deep .
but our minds are still hypnotized by them , and we have to disenthrall ourselves of some of them .
everybody who &apos;s spoken at ted has told us implicitly , or sometimes explicitly , a different story : that life is not linear ; it &apos;s organic .
he said , &quot; he was in a car wreck , and i pulled him out , gave him cpr , and i saved his wife &apos;s life as well . &quot;
and we have sold ourselves into a fast food model of education , and it &apos;s impoverishing our spirit and our energies as much as fast food is depleting our physical bodies .
there are great ones , like kipp &apos;s ; it &apos;s a great system .
many of you might be familiar with taz , the cartoon character , the one that spins around and around and around .
her guts were swimming with parasitic worms .
this is jonas .
and just as the tasmanian devil cancer is contagious through the spread of living cancer cells , so is this dog cancer .
music must be the thing for derek .
and in the end , derek , i think you agreed that we could actually have some fun playing the piano together .
dp : no .
but in america , they &apos;ve coined this term , &quot; the human ipod &quot; for derek , which i think is just missing the point , really , because derek , you &apos;re so much more than an ipod .
but i am going talk about : what are the big problems in the world ?
so the point is not to prioritize problems , but the point is to prioritize solutions to problems .
we &apos;d like to know these things .
then there &apos;s fair projects , good projects and very good projects .
or half the amount on doing an amazing amount of good ?
and the very best project would be to focus on hiv / aids .
much more likely , they will be two to four times richer than we are .
i &apos;m all for that .
if we worry too much about some things , we end by not worrying about other things .
it &apos;s been a severe disease for thousands of years .
and bed nets are a great tool .
it seems like the kind of question that people would spend a lot of time on , and we &apos;d understand very well .
if you &apos;re low-income in the united states , you have a higher chance of going to jail than you do of getting a four-year degree .
the variation is very , very small .
i sat down and i thought , &quot; what is going on ? &quot;
advise me -- when this kid acted up , how should i have dealt with that ? &quot;
thank you .
like a lot .
i never was pure .
do not fear what has blown up .
and al gore has spoken to why we need to hit one of these targets , and in reality what that means is in the next 30 to 40 years , we have to make 10 trillion watts or more of new clean energy somehow .
i am lucky enough to work with 30 of them .
this is what i see from the balcony of my hermitage in the himalayas .
and happiness , of course , is such a vague word , so let &apos;s say well-being .
so then , this just needs to have some experience .
but you cannot , at the same time , toward the same object , the same person , want to harm and want to do good .
they do , like , three years &apos; retreat , where they do meditate 12 hours a day .
so the whole point of that is not , sort of , to make , like , a circus thing of showing exceptional beings who can jump , or whatever .
if you think about it , this imperative is kind of the defining characteristic of our species , isn &apos;t it ?
these graphs are compelling , they &apos;re undulating , but from a human &apos;s perspective , they &apos;re actually not very useful .
they followed these little shifts in your mental activity .
so you can use this information to understand you in a responsive loop .
and from this , we can learn how to change the plot , the outcome and the character of our personal stories .
well i &apos;m here to suggest there &apos;s a better way , that less might actually equal more .
why have a six burner stove when you rarely use three ?
the course was good , but it was not the course content in itself that changed the mindset .
and we will think about that when we look at the wider picture of the world in 1858 .
but careful now -- we are approaching the first world war .
and they go quite closely together , and you can see that the similarity with india and china , in many ways , are greater than the differences with them .
and after second world war , united states is richer than u.k .
and will asia be able to handle that new position of being in charge of being the most mighty , and the governors of the world ?
the computer was cracked open .
i &apos;d like to leave you with the following thought : green fluorescent protein and antibodies are both totally natural products at the get-go .
those missions could be as simple as just a few way points , or they could be slightly longer and more complicated , to fly along a river system .
now these models are not just visually appealing , but they are also geometrically accurate , which means researchers can now measure the distance between trees , calculate surface area , the volume of vegetation , and so on , all of which are important information for monitoring the health of these forests .
that is quite sufficient for most of our conservation applications .
that &apos;s the same charles lindbergh who actually spent the rest of his life working with alexis at the rockefeller institute in new york in the area of the culture of organs .
so they know what to do .
this is actually a desktop inkjet printer , but instead of using ink , we &apos;re using cells .
so this is more challenging -- large organ , vascular , a lot of blood vessel supply , a lot of cells present .
i was missing school . it was pretty much miserable .
i know i was one of the first 10 people to have this surgery .
and so for me , it was really exciting just to see what it looks like if you could step outside and into a larger context , as though you were an astronaut , and see these two things as an object , because they are so intimately bound , and one is meaningless without the other .
i want to just say -- so this is jack , nick and louie .
there are lines in front of the one on the right , and there are lines behind the one on the left , and so it takes it into different planes .
ts : as it turns out , this device kind of comes in handy , because i don &apos;t have to have the fine motor skills to do , that i can operate slides , which is more of a mental process .
&lt; speaker &gt; moshe safdie &lt; / speaker &gt;
so a few years ago , we decided to go back and rethink habitat .
thank you .
and lastly , the only portrait of a male that leonardo painted , &quot; the musician . &quot;
here he is : leonardo da vinci .
so we &apos;re going to actually do a live exam to sort of see how libby &apos;s doing .
ed : all right . now last week , when i did this , you had me measure that spot to the right .
think about a coach , an agent online , that &apos;s going to help me do safe self-care .
now , the last thing that i want to talk to you about is care customization , because if you &apos;ve got care anywhere and you &apos;ve got care networking , those are going to go a long way towards improving our health care system , but there &apos;s still too much guesswork .
&lt; reviewer href = &quot; http : / / www.ted.com / profiles / 1108408 &quot; &gt; morton bast &lt; / reviewer &gt;
what you see over here , this yellow thing , this is not a death ray .
for impass , we can do many , many different types of motion .
we store potential energy to the elastic skin to make it move .
we actually have a fan club for the robot , darwin : dynamic anthropomorphic robot with intelligence .
the robots track and they team play amongst themselves .
at night when i go to bed , 3 - 4 a.m. in the morning , i lie down , close my eyes , and i see these lines and circles and different shapes floating around .
he gave a talk about how education and school kills creativity .
but yes , it &apos;s also true that the internet has problems , very serious problems , problems with security and problems with privacy .
basit and amjad ; they are still there .
so we can actually see in real time that we &apos;ve just blocked viruses in sweden and taiwan and russia and elsewhere .
once you gain access to other people &apos;s credit card information , you can just go online and buy whatever you want with this information .
and that code has been encrypted , so let &apos;s decrypt it .
in downtown st. petersburg , he actually crashed his car into another car .
i see beauty in the future of the internet , but i &apos;m worried that we might not see that .
and the same is more or less what santiago calatrava said when he said , &quot; light : i make it in my buildings for comfort . &quot;
it has only on one side this big , big glass window that helps to let the sunlight enter deep into the space and create a beautiful quality there and a great dynamic range .
it &apos;s a little bit of a different story , this health aspect of light , than what i &apos;m telling you today .
it was just a much smaller city , and the pace of urbanization is incredible and enormous .
we can go further .
we can do that in commercial spaces like this .
this was about 1925 .
this is not that they took me -- the work didn &apos;t take me -- i made the things particularly because i wanted to use them to see the world .
the director there said there were several women casting and producing my designs now in molds , and this was sold also to america .
so i was arrested quite early in stalin &apos;s purges , and spent 16 months in a russian prison .
and of course it &apos;s the dna that counts , so here &apos;s all the a , t , gs and cs that make up your genetic code , and give you all your charming characteristics .
but when they grew to a certain cell number all the bacteria turned on light simultaneously .
now the bacteria are dilute , that little hormone molecule is gone , so they &apos;re not making light -- but of course the squid doesn &apos;t care . it &apos;s asleep in the sand .
each bacteria uses a particular molecule that &apos;s its language that allows it to count its own siblings .
we thought , what if we made these bacteria so they can &apos;t talk or they can &apos;t hear ?
so in the spirit of ted they &apos;re doing things together because it makes a difference .
it &apos;s a big treat for me to get to come to this conference .
and so what i want to talk about today is trying to take these ideas that we &apos;ve seen in the musical culture and try to bring these towards reinventing the way we think about writing books , using them and teaching from them .
what about copying , reusing , right ?
because it &apos;s published on demand and it &apos;s developed from this repository of open materials .
and people who are teachers out here , whoever taught , you know this -- it &apos;s the interconnections between ideas that teaching is really all about .
behind that is the legal code , so if you want to very carefully construct it , and creative commons is taking off -- over 43 million things out there , licensed with a creative commons license .
i &apos;m here for two reasons . these two guys are my two sons ford and wren .
the guy did it all himself .
and i realized that &apos;s because the guys that i met were all very passionate about what they did .
the only mistake lies in that i &apos;m not able to perceive what it is that someone else did .
the only mistake is if i &apos;m not aware , if each individual musician is not aware and accepting enough of his fellow band member to incorporate the idea and we don &apos;t allow for creativity .
the gastric brooding frog lays its eggs just like any other frog -- then swallows them whole to incubate . that is , it did until it went extinct 30 years ago . paleontologist michael archer makes a case to bring back the gastric brooding frog and the thylacine , commonly known as the tasmanian tiger . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
they thought , this is incredible .
well , we had no real reason to expect it would , and we tried hundreds and hundreds of these .
it &apos;s not what you usually think about as a kangaroo , but these are meat-eating kangaroos .
it makes me very sad , because , while , it &apos;s a fascinating animal , and it &apos;s amazing to think that we had the technology to film it before it actually plunged off that cliff of extinction , we didn &apos;t , unfortunately , at this same time , have a molecule of concern about the welfare for this species .
it has to be a different species .
could we put it back in the throne of the king of beasts in tasmania where it belongs , restore that ecosystem ?
sometimes you might be able to put it back , but is that the safest way to make sure it never goes extinct again , and i don &apos;t think so .
nobody wants to drink blue algae-contaminated water , or swim in a blue algae-infested lake .
dna is our genetic heritage .
and because in order to get 15 percent of it to the plant , all the rest is lost , we have to add more and more .
remember that 80 percent is destined to be lost .
and instead of using a 100 percent dose , i &apos;m going to reduce it to 25 percent .
we have a technology that works , and one that , if used correctly , will alleviate some of the pressure we are putting on the world &apos;s phosphorus reserves .
the youngest son took his ninth -- a ninth of 18 is two .
because , after all , within living memory , they were hunters and gatherers , living pretty much like our ancestors lived for maybe 99 percent of the human story .
look at what you americans are doing in puerto rico . &quot;
stories are the key .
now it &apos;s not enough just to tell a story -- that &apos;s powerful -- but people need to experience the story .
we then came to northern jordan , to jerusalem , which is all about abraham , to bethlehem , and finally to the place where he &apos;s buried in hebron .
and so that &apos;s what it &apos;s about .
but they did it thanks to a common identity -- europe -- and a common economy .
&quot; you know , i am a virgin , &quot; she told me .
across the arab region , the only accepted context for sex is marriage -- approved by your parents , sanctioned by religion and registered by the state .
now , it &apos;s not as if it &apos;s all rosy in the marital bed either .
and it is the product of a complex historical process , one which has gained ground with the rise of islamic conservatism since the late 1970s .
then we get more personal with it .
when you &apos;re six , maybe you can do that .
see , it &apos;s one of the great blessings of my very unorthodox childhood that i wasn &apos;t ever asked to define myself as any one thing at any point .
i &apos;m io tillett wright , and i &apos;m an artist born and raised in new york city .
but here &apos;s what i was starting to learn that was really interesting : self evident truths doesn &apos;t erase the differences between us .
because really , they describe nothing that we see and no one that we know and nothing that we are .
so this was the thinking back then , and these individuals made these holes .
the electrodes are turned off now , and you can see that she has tremor .
so here he is now , back in israel where he lives , three months after the procedure , and here he is .
of course we can , right ?
so this is now in clinical trials .
&quot; what are you going to teach me about right and wrong ?
he learns his whys and wherefores , his causes and correlations , his logic , his fallacies .
so we decided , a bit fed-up with this world and also with the strong feeling in our stomach that this wasn &apos;t sustainable , to found a financial services firm based on our values , and we decided to incorporate feminine values into the world of finance .
have you seen the incredible urge out there to rebuild the very things that failed us ?
so let &apos;s move away from thinking about business here and philanthropy there , and let &apos;s start thinking about doing good business .
and i called it the muttering hat , because it emitted these muttering noises that were kind of tethered to you , but you could detach them and share them with somebody else .
and so kind of thinking about scale , my most recent obsession is actually with glaciers -- of course .
and so my intent is to actually just take the next 10 years and go on a series of collaborative projects where i work with people from different disciplines -- artists , technologists , scientists -- to kind of work on this project of how we can improve human-glacier relations .
the idea is , let &apos;s have some sensors that listen to these storms , this electrical firing , and see if you can , in the same time that it takes for this storm to leave the brain and reach the legs or the arms of an animal -- about half a second -- let &apos;s see if we can read these signals , extract the motor messages that are embedded in it , translate it into digital commands and send it to an artificial device that will reproduce the voluntary motor wheel of that brain in real time .
by all purposes and means , aurora &apos;s brain has incorporated that artificial device as an extension of her body .
and yet , they can find them by tactile discrimination , and they can press it and select it .
and you can see an image produced by this consortium .
it &apos;ll just bake your retinas .
they have a &quot; eureka ! &quot; moment , when we suddenly understand oil in a different context .
okay , so the politics of oil are very moral in the united states .
and so i &apos;m not saying these guys aren &apos;t liable to answer questions -- i &apos;m just saying that , when you focus on whether they are or are not a bunch of greedy bastards , you don &apos;t actually get around to the point of making laws that are either going to either change the way they operate , or you &apos;re going to get around and reducing our dependence on oil .
as you can see , our own production has fallen off as our reservoirs have gotten old and expensive to drill out .
we pay for it on april 15th , and we can &apos;t even calculate the cost of this involvement .
and one of the things that we need to do is , not only fix the fuel efficiency of our vehicles and make them much more efficient , but we also need to fix the economy in general .
we need to keep or minds on the molecules and not get distracted by the theater , not get distracted by the cognitive dissonance of the green possibilities that are out there .
so after having tried to make it work in high school with the limited resources i had , i went to university , met a few people , got it into practice , and we have a fully functioning product that &apos;s ready to go to the market . it &apos;s actually available on the market .
how is the connection between happiness and gratefulness ?
by experiencing , by becoming aware that every moment is a given moment , as we say .
we have been told that the road to peace is not a sprint , but is more like a marathon .
but after a while , this wears off .
we have a network for grateful living , and it has mushroomed .
men typically listen reductively .
listen to this -- this is an uncompressed piece of music .
it &apos;s fun to get into designing with sound .
so i &apos;m going to leave you with seven things you can do right now to improve your health with sound .
and because these materials are so prolific , because they &apos;re found in so many places , there &apos;s one other place you &apos;ll find this material , styrene , which is made from benzene , a known carcinogen .
so i &apos;d like to share with you the four basic steps required to make these materials .
but it &apos;s much faster than conventional farming .
now , what we were trying to understand was , is this true ?
now , when you consider the fact that , historically , the r &amp; amp ; amp ; d center of a multinational company was always in the headquarters , or in the country of origin of that multinational company , to have 750 r &amp; amp ; amp ; d centers of multinational corporations in india is truly a remarkable figure .
and the last kind of innovation , invisible innovation coming out of india is what we call management innovation .
well , in 2010 , they decided they &apos;re not going to reveal this data anymore , so i had to make some estimates based on various sources .
we need a little bit of police ; we need a little bit of military , but for defense .
he said , &quot; you know that i kind of like meditation , and i pray . &quot;
and instead of going home , she conferred with all the other women that she works with , who said to her , &quot; stay out . we need you out .
she also received the peace prize .
i was asked by a good friend , fred bernstein , to do an interview for the october issue of architect magazine , and he and i kind of had a good chuckle when we saw the magazine released with the title , &quot; can this planner save detroit ? &quot;
they &apos;re beginning to see illegal activities on these properties , like illegal dumping , and they know that because the city has lost so much population , their costs for water , electricity , gas are rising , because there are not enough people to pay property taxes to help support the services that they need .
then we also wanted to look at other ways of using land in addition to growing food and transforming landscape into much more productive uses , so that it could be used for storm water management , for example , by using surface lakes and retention ponds , that created neighborhood amenities , places of recreation , and actually helped to elevate adjacent property levels .
all the theories in physics that we have today properly explain what is called normal matter -- the stuff that we &apos;re all made of -- and that &apos;s four percent of the universe .
it is the largest lake in the world . it &apos;s 800 km long .
these are four 8.2 meter telescopes .
this hut was built by robert falcon scott and his men when they first came to antarctica on their first expedition to go to the south pole .
here &apos;s a scene that shows you the balloon and the payload end-to-end .
because , before the spread of coffee and tea through british culture , what people drank -- both elite and mass folks drank -- day-in and day-out , from dawn until dusk was alcohol .
it &apos;s a new configuration that has never formed before .
and that means that we have to change some of our models of what innovation and deep thinking really looks like , right .
they have a feeling that there &apos;s an interesting problem , but they don &apos;t quite have the tools yet to discover them .
it &apos;s october of 1957 , and sputnik has just launched , and we &apos;re in laurel maryland , at the applied physics lab associated with johns hopkins university .
and then they played around with it a little bit more , and they talked to a couple of their colleagues who had other kind of specialties .
i mean , here you have these guys who basically thought they were just following this hunch , this little passion that had developed , then they thought they were fighting the cold war , and then it turns out they &apos;re just helping somebody find a soy latte .
and yes , you also interact using natural gestures , both hands , etc .
but it &apos;s not perfect yet , it &apos;s very much a work in progress .
these 1.4 million cellular radio masts , or base stations , consume a lot of energy .
and wouldn &apos;t it be great to use that for wireless communications ?
not usable for a youtube video .
you &apos;re critical .
that &apos;s aside .
in hospitals , for new medical instruments ; in streets for traffic control .
we &apos;re sending his marrow across the country to save the life of a child with leukemia .
and we found , to our surprise , that we not only got bone marrow out , but we got 10 times the stem cell activity in the marrow from the marrow miner , compared to the normal device .
let me show you what i mean .

or , &quot; he won &apos;t stop raping me .
imagine having real time data on every one of those issues .
so i began experimenting with other ways to fragment images where the shake wouldn &apos;t affect the work , like dipping my feet in paint and walking on a canvas , or , in a 3d structure consisting of two-by-fours , creating a 2d image by burning it with a blowtorch .
so i &apos;d dip my hands in paint , and i just attacked the canvas , and i actually hit so hard that i bruised a joint in my pinkie and it was stuck straight for a couple of weeks .
looking at limitations as a source of creativity changed the course of my life .
okay . some bad news first .
audience : go faster . faster please .
i want to make you better at stress .
well , oxytocin doesn &apos;t only act on your brain .
it &apos;s equally wise to go for the stressful job so long as you believe that you can handle it , in some sense ?
every now and then an electric shock is applied to the floor , which pains the dogs .
for maybe 10 percent of the money , you could have paid all of the world &apos;s top male and female supermodels to walk up and down the train handing out free chateau petrus to all the passengers .
all of you know this actually from when you go in to buy a television .
i think they &apos;re right .
it has to be said of the germans that the germans and the french are doing a brilliant job of creating a united europe .
this was a woman who read coffee grounds to see the future and melted lead into mysterious shapes to fend off the evil eye .
my mother came home one day with a turquoise notebook and asked me if i &apos;d be interested in keeping a personal journal .
i lived in a very vibrant , diverse neighborhood where i wrote several of my novels .
yet as much as i love stories , recently , i &apos;ve also begun to think that they lose their magic if and when a story is seen as more than a story .
in this way , not only the writers themselves , but also their fictional characters become the representatives of something larger .
the sufis say , &quot; knowledge that takes you not beyond yourself is far worse than ignorance . &quot;

if i had to place it on an arbitrary spectrum , i &apos;d say it falls somewhere between poetry and lies .
three things i &apos;ve tried to avoid my entire life .
and he used to be the usa today monday morning guy .
sheikha al mayassa : globalizing the local , localizing the global
and i think a lot of people in this room , i can see a lot of you are in the same position as myself .
in few hours , shirin neshat , my friend from iran who &apos;s a very important artist for us will be talking to you .
who are you playing ?
ladies and gentlemen , thank you very much . shokran .
two of the largest memes that have come out of this site some of you might be familiar with are these lolcats -- just silly pictures of cats with text .
and so , you know , 390 percent approval rating ain &apos;t so bad .
we &apos;re moving towards persistent identity .
cp : there are , certainly .
cp : at first , very kind of pained , awkward conversations .
the size of the blob in this graph represents the size of the population , and the level of the graph represents gdp per capita .
well , it uses sexual reproduction .
he doesn &apos;t need adam .
tens ? hundreds ? thousands ?
even in england , we don &apos;t leave reproduction to the queen .
and the other thing there &apos;s no evidence for is exchange between groups , because the objects that you find in neanderthal remains , the tools they made , are always made from local materials .
go back to this image again and ask yourself , not only who made it and for who , but who knew how to make it .
because through the cloud , through crowd sourcing , through the bottom-up world that we &apos;ve created , where not just the elites but everybody is able to have their ideas and make them meet and mate , we are surely accelerating the rate of innovation .
so thomas watson wasn &apos;t listening to us .
now this didn &apos;t make any sense , and like any reasonable engineer or scientist , they assumed that the problem must be the technology itself , it must be the dish .
by the end of the century , there was nothing left but these beautiful skins in museum specimen drawers .
all she needed from those specimens at the smithsonian was a little bit of toe pad tissue , because down in there is what is called ancient dna .
so if he &apos;s successful , she won &apos;t be the last .
so what do you do about that ?
a bit of cloning , you can get them back .
now , there &apos;s the shifting baseline problem , which is , so when these things come back , they might replace some birds that are there that people really know and love .
and on top of that , these systems actually cost in the tens of thousands of dollars .
okay .
and also , colors , lighting , sound and effects can dynamically respond to your emotional state to heighten the experience that you &apos;re having , in real time .
so i wore it when we talked about iraq .
and i said , &quot; well i &apos;ve been a woman for 60 years , but i &apos;ve only been secretary of state for a few minutes . &quot;
the women in bosnia were being raped .
when i was secretary of state , there were only 13 other women foreign ministers .

they fall apart , they disintegrate , and they end up here .
it doesn &apos;t radiate .
and if the demo gods are willing , in about 10 seconds or so we should see it .
so we put a little sleeve on the back , but we should be able to get this guy to wake up too .
it really wasn &apos;t on the radar screen .
the ocean contains most of the exchangeable heat on the planet .
it &apos;s the andrill project .
so we know there &apos;s an ice shelf overhead .
it &apos;s about a meter tall pavona clavus colony .
and we &apos;ve been working at this fascinating uplift here in urbina bay .
and there &apos;s five or six different compilations there , but each one of those compilations reflects input from hundreds of these kinds of records from corals .
there are many organisms that build their shells out of calcium carbonate -- plants and animals both .
we &apos;re 25 , 26 years after the advent of the macintosh , which was an astoundingly seminal event in the history of human-machine interface and in computation in general .
they also don &apos;t understand time , but that &apos;s a matter for a separate talk .
they get a little shorter at 9 a.m .
and the part that isn &apos;t spatial can often be spatialized to allow our wetware to make greater sense of it .
well , that doesn &apos;t really cut it anymore .
and we probably need , well , we probably need a cowboy to be quite honest .
so this is the inevitability about it .
and my little sister wanted to be a pilot -- god help her .
so just like johnny cash &apos;s sue , a boy given a girl &apos;s name , i would grow up and learn from experience how to be tough and how to survive , when they were no longer there to protect me , or just take it all away .
and i &apos;m in one of the most competitive environments in the world , where you work hard , play hard , you gotta be the best , you gotta be the best .
and i had no idea that this man was going to change my life .
and i had no idea where i was going . i had no idea .
and then i remember thinking about that eye specialist asking me , &quot; what do you want to be ? what do you want to be ?
i had no idea how . i had no idea how you hire an elephant , get an elephant .
and you know , the oddest part is , when i was on my way traveling here to ted , i &apos;ll be honest , i was petrified .
and i say , &quot; empathy .
and so i get angry , and i get pissed , as do lots of average people .
you &apos;re arab muslim living in iraq .
this is what you see .
once a life of happiness and joy and suddenly , pain and sorrow .
they don &apos;t know anything about him , but you do .
and then your cousin says , &quot; hey cuz , check out this website .
of course , you got it wrong .
as an american , how do you feel about this picture ?
you see , that &apos;s empathy .
&lt; speaker &gt; robin ince &lt; / speaker &gt;
and that to me as well , that if you think i &apos;m worried about losing worlds , well many worlds theory -- one of the most beautiful , fascinating , sometimes terrifying ideas from the quantum interpretation -- is a wonderful thing .
love does not die because of that thing .
you think , what should i do ?
i have chosen to make silly jokes about quantum mechanics and the copenhagen interpretation .
you can get on your kinect and you can have unicorns dancing and rainbows spraying out of your mobile phone .
you can type in an url and put in a 404 and these will pop .
but now what we &apos;re looking at is not an extension of the physical self , but an extension of the mental self , and because of that , we &apos;re able to travel faster , communicate differently .
and i said , &quot; dad , dad , dad , how do you do that ? &quot;
and so there are some psychological effects that happen with this .
how could this have gone by like lightning ?
it &apos;s 14 hours 58 minutes . who cares the last two minutes ? &quot;
and it &apos;s odd , isn &apos;t it ?
i don &apos;t know if you can still see the red line here and up the arm .
and i guess the story is that even navy seals who are stung by the box jelly , they &apos;re done .
and they do this wrapping .
yeah .
thank you . thank you .
not only that -- we always have this vague notion that something &apos;s expected of us .
consequently , we have .
hollywood gathers around power tables , and the valley gathers around power tables .
i started a couple of businesses that i thought would be the ticket to financial freedom .
and she started it about 10 years ago , and today , she educates over a quarter million african girls .
in 2005 , we launched our first slate of films , &quot; murder ball , &quot; &quot; north country , &quot; &quot; syriana &quot; and &quot; good night and good luck . &quot;
and it &apos;s really changed the debate on global warming .
and i want to thank you all for having me here today .
what &apos;s the minimum amount of words you would need to do a tedtalk ?
so for $ 60 , i could summarize a thousand tedtalks into just 600 summaries , which would actually be quite nice .
for example , all the courageous tedtalks : &quot; people dying , &quot; or &quot; people suffering , &quot; was also one , &quot; with easy solutions around . &quot;
that &apos;s the unknown world , and today we &apos;ve only explored about 3 percent of what &apos;s out there in the ocean .
here &apos;s an octopus . sometimes they don &apos;t want to be seen when they move because predators can see them .
theo jansen : i want to put these forms of life on the beaches .
so , 5,000 years after the invention of the wheel , we have a new wheel . and i will show you , in the next video -- can you start it , please ? -- that very heavy loads can be moved .
so when the storm is coming up , it drives a pin into the ground .
as the trevor project says , it gets better .
what percentage of that was accounted for by foreign direct investment ?
and as i was laughing , i was thinking , i really need a more coherent response , especially on national tv . i &apos;d better write something about this .
or to take an even more striking example , when the chicago council on foreign relations did a survey of americans , asking them to guess what percentage of the federal budget went to foreign aid , the guess was 30 percent , which is slightly in excess of the actual level — — of u.s. governmental commitments to federal aid .
they turn a social network from virtual to actual , and kind of rebooted the 21st century .
and if you live on less than $ 1.25 a day , if you live in that kind of poverty , this is not just data .
we know the obstacles that are in our way right now , in difficult times .
we are going to win because we don &apos;t play their dirty games .
if you ask people the question : where do you really need to go when you need to get something done ?
i was at work .
there &apos;s five of them , and in order to get to the really deep ones , the really meaningful ones , you have to go through the early ones .
you decide when you want to go downstairs or go for a walk .
and meetings are just toxic , terrible , poisonous things during the day at work .
these things don &apos;t exist outside of the office .
another thing you can try is switching from active communication and collaboration , which is like face-to-face stuff , tapping people on the shoulder , saying hi to them , having meetings , and replace that with more passive models of communication , using things like email and instant messaging , or collaboration products -- things like that .
and i thought , &quot; great .
and i know that i am doing a service to myself and my family .
why english ? in a single word : opportunity .

we had to throw out the plywood legs and make new cane ones .
and now we would like to introduce you to joey .
you see the string tendon from the hyena , the hyena &apos;s front leg , automatically pulls the hoop up .
and it &apos;s very much an in-the-moment activity that they &apos;re engaged in .
so i &apos;m at the end of this bad breakup , i &apos;m 30 years old , i figure i &apos;m probably going to have to date somebody for about six months before i &apos;m ready to get monogamous and before we can sort of cohabitate , and we have to have that happen for a while before we can get engaged .
and the matchmaker would sort of think through all of this , put two people together , and that would be the end of it .
so i run home , i call my mother , i call my sister , and as i do , at the end of each one of these terrible , terrible dates , i regale them with the details .
i wanted somebody was jew ... ish , so i was looking for somebody who had the same background and thoughts on our culture , but wasn &apos;t going to force me to go to shul every friday and saturday .
i found smileygirl1978 .
also , optimistic language matters a lot .
he talked in detail about travel .
and the watchmaker turned around and said , &quot; god can see it . &quot;
you see , using this bit , the thinky bit , the slow bit of the brain -- using that .
and all of a sudden , this plastic bag was extremely beautiful to me .
the eyebrows are doing this , the eyes are defocused , and the mouth is hanging open .
but they &apos;re both different .
i can &apos;t tell you how wonderful this is .
but then , of course , the consumer says that doesn &apos;t really matter .
the comprehension of it leads us to a greater and heightened sense of the beauty of what &apos;s actually going on .
no time . it says i have two minutes left , so we can &apos;t do this .
wassup .
i can sample in my own sounds and i can play it back just by hitting the pads here .
my last book was about the story behind the shi &apos;a-sunni split , and for that i &apos;d worked closely with the earliest islamic histories , so i knew the events to which the koran constantly refers , its frame of reference .
that idea only came into being 300 years later , and most islamic scholars see it as the equivalent of people with wings sitting on clouds and strumming harps .
and there was silence in the class , and finally one woman stood up , &#91; inaudible name &#93; , and she said &quot; khrew , &quot; which means &quot; teacher . &quot;
and i said , &quot; but there &apos;s been tens of millions of dollars that have recently gone in to the development of the legal system here .
and i believe that if we can come together as a world community to support not only defenders , but also everyone in the system who is looking towards it , we can end torture as an investigative tool .
i &apos;ll just say , july .
the average concussive impact is 95 gs .
let me tell you what i &apos;ve come up with .
now i thought that it was because i have this totally compelling helmet crusade , right , this epiphany of tom &apos;s .
nelson decided to become a treatment activist and join up with other groups .
so surely if a patent pool could be established to ramp up the production of military airplanes , we should be able to do something similar to tackle the hiv / aids epidemic .
&lt; speaker &gt; david deutsch &lt; / speaker &gt;
what does a typical place in the universe look like ?
not just a superficial image of it , though it contains that as well , but an explanatory model , embodying the same mathematical relationships and the same causal structure .
well , again , it &apos;s dark out there to human senses . but all you &apos;ve got to do is take a telescope , even one of present-day design , look out and you &apos;ll see the same galaxies as we do from here .
because if it &apos;s true that our best option at the moment is to prevent co2 emissions with something like the kyoto protocol , with its constraints on economic activity and its enormous cost of hundreds of billions of dollars or whatever it is , then that is already a disaster by any reasonable measure .
now , before i go any further , yes , i know it all began with &quot; britain &apos;s got talent . &quot;
and she &apos;s out there .
but at least it &apos;s just a kind of artwork to explore our ideas about a different future .
and the same approach can be applied to technology as well .
and they are : start the month clean-shaven , rock a mustache -- not a beard , not a goatee , a mustache -- for the 30 days of november , and then we agreed that we would come together at the end of the month , have a mustache-themed party , and award a prize for the best , and of course , the worst mustache .
so again we persisted , and foster &apos;s brewing came to the party and gave us our first ever sponsorship , and that was enough for me to quit my job , i did consulting on the side .
and they go , &quot; what , what do you mean ? &quot;
so now we &apos;re funding them to the tune of about five or six million dollars to collaborate and bringing them together , and that &apos;s a unique thing in the cancer world , and we know , through that collaboration , it will accelerate outcomes .
as it turns out , there &apos;s a pattern .
here &apos;s our new law firm : we have the best lawyers with the biggest clients , we always perform for our clients who do business with us .
here &apos;s the best part : none of what i &apos;m telling you is my opinion .
and back in the early 20th century , the pursuit of powered man flight was like the dot com of the day .
and , eventually , on december 17th , 1903 , the wright brothers took flight , and no one was there to even experience it .
it &apos;s because they wanted to be first .
people don &apos;t buy what you do ; they buy why you do it , and what you do simply serves as the proof of what you believe .
we followed , not for him , but for ourselves .
and if people feel used , worthless and ashamed , because something horrible has happened to them , then they retreat , and they fall into social isolation , and they do not dare to tell this evil to other people or to their loved ones , because they do not want to burden them .
but for that , we already have the training manuals , which are approved by the ministry and moreover , this approach is now part of the mental health strategy in afghanistan .
maybe you think about the tragically boring board games that hold us hostage in thanksgiving situations .
and this is one of my favorite shots here .
and so , to me , i wanted more value in this , so when she asked if she could play a game , i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
i don &apos;t think the new world felt too new worldly exciting to the people who were brought over on slave ships .

they control 90 percent of the commercially produced seeds in our country .
the antithesis of this whole thing is sustainable food .
because eight-year-olds don &apos;t get to decide -- and if they do , you should be in therapy .
chicken nuggets , tater tots , chocolate milk with high fructose , canned fruit cocktail -- a reimbursable meal .
we can &apos;t keep serving kids processed crap , full of chemicals , and expect these are going to be healthy citizens .
where is socialization ? where is discussion ?
it &apos;s sort of this &quot; duh &quot; thing .

fabian oefner : psychedelic science
now in los angeles , you could get a decent sunburn just on any of the beaches , but i got mine indoors , and what happened is that , if you &apos;re shooting at 3,000 frames per second , you need to have a silly amount of light , lots of lights .
let me now turn to the last project , which involves the national beverage of scotland .
so , i have now showed you three projects , and you might ask yourself , what is it good for ?
luria looked at people just before they entered the scientific age , and he found that these people were resistant to classifying the concrete world .
if a wise person came from the north pole and told me the bears were white , i might believe him , but every bear that i have seen is a brown bear . &quot;
compare the doctor in 1900 , who really had only a few tricks up his sleeve , with the modern general practitioner or specialist , with years of scientific training .
and if someone of the older generation says , well , our government takes care of us , and it &apos;s up to their government to take care of them , they &apos;re just not willing to take the hypothetical seriously .
one of the ways in which we would like to deal with the sophistication of the modern world is through politics , and sadly you can have humane moral principles , you can classify , you can use logic on abstractions , and if you &apos;re ignorant of history and of other countries , you can &apos;t do politics .
now , this simple equation , even for those of you who don &apos;t like equations , is something that you &apos;re quite used to .
so , this is an example of how this idea that the quickness with which things come to mind can give you a sense of their probability -- how this idea could lead you astray . it &apos;s not just puzzles , though .
it costs you a dollar to buy the ticket and , if you win , you get 20 bucks . is this a good bet ?
what you knew is , you paid three dollars in the past ; 25 is outrageous .
what does the loss of 20 dollars along the way have to do ?
these are subjects coming to an experiment to be asked the simplest of all questions : how much will you enjoy eating potato chips one minute from now ?
now , you can see , this is the problem of shifting comparisons , because what you &apos;re doing is , you &apos;re comparing the 100 bucks to the purchase that you &apos;re making , but when you go to spend that money you won &apos;t be making that comparison .
well , by and large people are enormously impatient .
people always think more is better than less : 60 is always better than 50 , and they always think now is better than later : the bars on this side are higher than the bars on this side .
if i told you that there was a plague that was going to kill 15,000 americans next year , you might be alarmed if you didn &apos;t find out it was the flu .
i don &apos;t want to say -- please , i &apos;m going to get quoted somewhere as saying , &quot; terrorism is fine and we shouldn &apos;t be so distressed . &quot;
jay walker : you know , economists love to talk about the stupidity of people who buy lottery tickets . but i suspect you &apos;re making the exact same error you &apos;re accusing those people of , which is the error of value .
but one thing that psychologists have tried that seems to work is to get people to imagine the future more vividly .
the explanation of that paradox is that , within our societies , we &apos;re looking at relative income or social position , social status -- where we are in relation to each other and the size of the gaps between us .
but once again , if you look at that measure of child well-being , in relation to national income per person , there &apos;s no relationship , no suggestion of a relationship .
but look at the scale of the differences .
one is that , in graph after graph , we find the countries that do worse , whatever the outcome , seem to be the more unequal ones , and the ones that do well seem to be the nordic countries and japan .
we show that on about five different sets of data covering educational outcomes and health in the united states and internationally .
and indeed , people know the causal links quite well in some of these outcomes .
until biofabrication is better understood , it is clear that , initially at least , more people would be willing to wear novel materials than would be willing to eat novel foods , no matter how delicious .
imagine that in this facility , instead of brewing beer , we were brewing leather or meat .
these blocks represent leds .
here &apos;s what he wrote in starting that out .
but what i think comes next is far more interesting .
you &apos;re thinking , the poor girl up there -- she thinks she &apos;s at a beauty pageant .
so i &apos;m the living product of two cultures coming together .
did a stint at mtv , made a film called &quot; startup.com , &quot; and i &apos;ve done a couple of music films -- but in 2003 , when the war in iraq was about to start , it was a very surreal feeling for me because before the war started , there was kind of this media war that was going on .
i will pay for their study .
he kind of redefined us as an american population .
and that you give israel an alibi to carry on ?
i know where you guys are coming from .
so if you imagine this day when all around the world you have theaters from around the world and places where we project films .
pangea cinema -- the day the world comes together .
you can be a general , a politician , an economist who is depressed , a musician in a minor key , a painter in dark colors .
so again i am a believer in the radical architecture .
our whole practice depends on computing .
it &apos;s also , just like life , the asking of questions .
and of course buildings have their shapes .
you know it costs a lot of money and so on , but yes , it should not play it safe .
it &apos;s such a complex project .
you have to fight for what you believe . you don &apos;t always win everything you want to win . but you can steer the process .
these are enormous questions for those of us who work in this terrain .
they currently are the best opportunities for artists to have lives of economic dignity -- not opulence -- of dignity .
when i was five years old i fell in love with airplanes .
you had to learn about aeronautics .
and i couldn &apos;t choose airplanes because they had gotten sort of unromantic at that point , even though i &apos;d done a lot of airplane work , on the interiors .
there are drawbacks to this .
and they go up easily .
so that &apos;s where a headrest comes in .
the thing that really amazes me is that , today , people spend about eight billion real dollars a year buying virtual items that only exist inside video games .
the biggest games in the world today are measuring more than one billion points of data about their players , about what everybody does -- far more detail than you &apos;d ever get from any website .
but we don &apos;t just have pies in the boxes .
it &apos;s already been done at the university of indiana in the states , among other places .
in reward terms , it &apos;s not money ; it &apos;s not being given cash -- that &apos;s nice -- it &apos;s doing stuff with our peers , watching us , collaborating with us .
in this talk from ted university 2009 , veteran rock climber matthew childs shares nine pointers for rock climbing . these handy tips bear on an effective life at sea level , too .
the interesting thing about this climb is it &apos;s not that hard .
jim fallon : exploring the mind of a killer
a key thing is that the major violence genes , it &apos;s called the mao-a gene .
she then told me about our own family tree .
they have the same brain , and the same eeg .
the white line is for the u.k. , and then the u.s .
it &apos;s a truism that your standard of living rises faster than productivity , rises faster than output per hour , if hours per person increased .
and then , in addition to that , at the same time , hand tools were replaced by massive electric tools and hand-powered electric tools , all achieved by electricity .
they had put in underground sewer pipes , and as a result , one of the great scourges of the late 19th century , waterborne diseases like cholera , began to disappear .
your challenge is , can you match what we achieved ?
so , notice that , as more people join in , it &apos;s less risky .
now language &apos;s subversive power has been recognized throughout the ages in censorship , in books you can &apos;t read , phrases you can &apos;t use and words you can &apos;t say .
now if we make some guesses about how long homo erectus lived , what their generation time was , that &apos;s about 40,000 generations of parents to offspring , and other individuals watching , in which that hand axe didn &apos;t change .
and we really had only two options for dealing with the conflicts that visual theft would bring .
the other one says , &quot; fine . looks good to me .
they &apos;re far closer together than that . &quot;
and so if language really is the solution to the crisis of visual theft , if language really is the conduit of our cooperation , the technology that our species derived to promote the free flow and exchange of ideas , in our modern world , we confront a question .
my work is about the behaviors that we all engage in unconsciously , on a collective level .
and i wanted to show the number .
and knowing what we know about the destructive power of cigarettes , we continue to allow our children , our sons and daughters , to be in the presence of the influences that start them smoking .
and one of the causes of this , i think , is that as each of us attempts to build this new kind of worldview , this holoptical worldview , this holographic image that we &apos;re all trying to create in our mind of the interconnection of things : the environmental footprints 1,000 miles away of the things that we buy ; the social consequences 10,000 miles away of the daily decisions that we make as consumers .
he looked at the odds of another world war , of a massive volcanic eruption , even of an asteroid hitting the earth .
this worked well for most pathogens , somewhat well for crafty bugs like flu , but not at all for hiv , for which humans have no natural immunity .
so that &apos;s why every year you can catch a slightly different strain of flu .
now , what does this mean ?
if you can cripple these with specific antibodies , you could cripple all versions of the flu .
so right now , the world can produce about 350 million doses of flu vaccine for the three strains , and we can up that to about 1.2 billion doses if we want to target a single variant like swine flu .
no longer do the poor and vulnerable need to be threatened by infectious diseases , or indeed , anybody .
the world needs people like you . thank you .
now , you &apos;re not as thick as two short planks , but you sound like it when you say &quot; earth , &quot; because that demonstration , if i turned around this way -- that earth plane would be as thin as paper .
and in a two-dimensional world , we do know about the third dimension but we don &apos;t use it because to go up requires an awful lot of energy against gravity .
chris asked us to show stuff that hasn &apos;t been shown before .
now , there she goes , right overhead .
so we &apos;ve run two flight schools .
you &apos;re seeing here images of three years , four-year-olds , and five-year-old children who have been trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation .
these are men who buy you for an hour , for a day , and use you , throw you .
she is an illiterate girl , trained , skilled as a welder .
if i &apos;m here today , i &apos;m here not only as sunitha krishnan .
the first question there is why china has grown so much faster than india .
country 1 has more telephones , and country 1 has a longer system of railways .
by 2008 , country a has surpassed country b with $ 700 per capita gdp as compared with $ 650 per capita gdp .
the philippines didn &apos;t succeed .
if you made that decision in 1965 , the down side of that is the next year we have the cultural revolution .
it depends on a distinction that you draw between statics of the political system and the dynamics of the political system .
it has the improving fundamentals .
on the right-hand side , you see an ultrasonic transducer .
what is typical to those conditions , to essential tremor for example , is inability to drink or eat cereal or soup without spilling everything all over you , or write legibly so people can understand it , and be really independent in your life without the help of others .
and it does this burst of energy .
they are dependent on others .
he rides his horse to their mountain cabin regularly .
she was offered a hysterectomy , but this is an inconceivable proposition for someone who wants to keep her pregnancy option .
is this going to matter in 50 or 100 years ?
&quot; pro-speras , &quot; &quot; speras , &quot; hope -- in accordance with our hopes and expectations .
what i &apos;ll try and do , is i &apos;ll try and paraphrase it is sort of human terms .
it was above the gdp for three years in a row just before the crisis .
and i had finally got around to doing some draft stripping , installing insulation around the windows and doors to keep out the drafts .
and i just want to , very quickly , show you this .
and this too requires investment , investment -- for example , in places -- places where we can connect , places where we can participate , shared spaces , concert halls , gardens , public parks , libraries , museums , quiet centers , places of joy and celebration , places of tranquility and contemplation , sites for the &quot; cultivation of a common citizenship , &quot; in michael sandel &apos;s lovely phrase .
and actually in the period through which we &apos;ve been working over the last 18 years -- partly because of the financial crisis and a little bit of humility in the profession of economics -- actually people are engaging in this issue in all sorts of countries around the world .
as i &apos;ve said , when we &apos;re born , we don &apos;t choose our parents , and when we go to school , we don &apos;t choose our school .
because all of my best school friends were getting dolled up to get married with a lot of dowry , and here i was with a tennis racket and going to school and doing all kinds of extracurricular activities .
now i was known as &quot; here &apos;s a woman that &apos;s not going to listen . &quot;
we converted this into an ashram -- from a prison to an ashram through education .
this is a concept which i introduced to listen to complaints , listen to grievances .
for those of us on the ground in those early days , it was clear for even the most disaster-hardened veterans that haiti was something different .
and it is even used for sensitive issues such as building awareness around gender-based violence .
they also have their own news network on youtube with 36,000 viewers at the moment .
we now have the tools . we now have the possibilities .
so what we &apos;ve got here now is the global footprint of all the tedx talks over the last four years exploding out around the world from new york all the way down to little old new zealand in the corner .
we might just say , well , what are the most popular talks out there ?
i wouldn &apos;t know .
was she pregnant ? did she want his baby ?
i was being asked and paid to do front covers .
you know , what does tony blair get up to in private with his fashion guru ?
and i think it doesn &apos;t really matter that my work is considered humorous , in a way ; i think it &apos;s a way in for me to deal with the importance of imagery and how we read all our information through imagery .
chris asked me to tell again how we found the structure of dna .
so i went to indiana , which was actually as good as caltech in genetics , and besides , they had a really good basketball team .
this is a photograph several years later , when bragg had cause to smile .
well , if the peak ph that cells have is around seven , those hydrogen bonds couldn &apos;t exist .
so , you know , if it didn &apos;t work this way , you might as well believe it , because you didn &apos;t have any other scheme .
so there , that &apos;s what chris wanted me to do , it was -- so what happened since then ?
looking at an individual is about 3,000 dollars . and the parent of a child with asperger &apos;s disease , the high-intelligence autism , had sent his thing to a conventional company ; they didn &apos;t do it .
from rockets to stock markets , many of humanity &apos;s most thrilling creations are powered by math . so why do kids lose interest in it ? conrad wolfram says the part of math we teach -- calculation by hand -- isn &apos;t just tedious , it &apos;s mostly irrelevant to real mathematics and the real world . he presents his radical idea : teaching kids math through computer programming .
well , i think there are about three reasons : technical jobs so critical to the development of our economies , what i call &quot; everyday living &quot; -- to function in the world today , you &apos;ve got to be pretty quantitative , much more so than a few years ago : figure out your mortgages , being skeptical of government statistics , those kinds of things -- and thirdly , what i would call something like logical mind training , logical thinking .
now it &apos;s understandable that this has all got intertwined over hundreds of years .
see , the thing we &apos;re doing right now is we &apos;re forcing people to learn mathematics .
my daughter gave me a rather nice anecdote on this .
they &apos;ve got hair all over them .
traditionally it &apos;s been by how difficult it is to calculate , but now we can reorder it by how difficult it is to understand the concepts , however hard the calculating .
we have got to make sure that we can move our economies forward , and also our societies , based on the idea that people can really feel mathematics .
this information is also pretty staggering .
we just started mailing it to our friends .
we &apos;ve completed now clinical trials in four mouse models of this disease .
unlike a drug company , we don &apos;t have a pipeline that we can deposit these molecules into .
after all , one of the things that &apos;s hardest for all of us to do is to figure out what other people are thinking and feeling .
but then after they stared for a long time , they would just give her the crackers , what they thought everybody must like .
whereas the chickens are actually mature within a couple of months .
so they &apos;re the protected blue sky guys who just have to go out and learn and have good ideas , and we &apos;re production and marketing .
and using this very simple machine , my lab and others have done dozens of studies showing just how good babies are at learning about the world .
boy : this one lighted up , and this one nothing .
i think babies and children are actually more conscious than we are as adults .
i don &apos;t want to say too much about how wonderful babies are .
this is the land .
and this is a model that they did of that seven-screen presentation .
you try things out .
it &apos;s kind of a brutal quote .
and here is some family pictures .
ed : no , bud . &quot; d &quot; &apos; s right . at buddy &apos;s -- audience : party . love .
they have trading cards and all sorts of cool things .
so this is charles &apos; voice .
all that great thinking needs to really get about solving pretty key problems .
and that &apos;s why we have to use our muscle energy to stand up , to walk around and to lift things .
in that time , novocure &apos;s developed two systems -- one system for cancers in the head and another system for cancers in the trunk of the body .
at this point , he was told by his doctors that he had about 3 months to live .
bd : novocure &apos;s also working on lung cancer as the second target .
strapped to a jet-powered wing , yves rossy is the jetman -- flying free , his body as the rudder , above the swiss alps and the grand canyon . after a powerful short film shows how it works , rossy takes the tedglobal stage to share the experience and thrill of flying .
and his equipment as well .
i have 55 kilos on my back .
so breitling &apos;s four engines .
so i was at my minimum altitude in that vector -- fast -- so i pulled that .
and then the landing , as we have seen , arriving on this side of the channel , is through a parachute .
but this is different .
the nodes in the network are the system &apos;s components and the links are given by the interactions .
about 10 years ago , mr. tronchetti provera had ownership and control in a small company , which had ownership and control in a bigger company .
it would be really great if it has the power to help end the gridlock created by conflicting ideas , which appears to be paralyzing our globalized world .
i grew up with the colors of war -- the red colors of fire and blood , the brown tones of earth as it explodes in our faces and the piercing silver of an exploded missile , so bright that nothing can protect your eyes from it .
these just become numbers that we refer to .
so that woman walked for 20 years , so she would not be kidnapped again .
are there good news ? of course , there are good news . there are lots of good news .
we looked at rooms that were naturally ventilated , where the hospital let us turn off the mechanical ventilation in a wing of the building and pry open the windows that were no longer operable , but they made them operable for our study .
bill gates : teachers need real feedback
we &apos;re tied for 15th with iceland and poland .
and what we found is very exciting .
once i &apos;m finished taping , then i put it in my computer , and then i &apos;ll scan it and take a peek at it .
it would put us on a path to making sure all our students get a great education , find a career that &apos;s fulfilling and rewarding , and have a chance to live out their dreams .
and if &quot; where do you come from ? &quot;
and in fact , in canada &apos;s largest city , toronto , the average resident today is what used to be called a foreigner , somebody born in a very different country .
you all know that crazy system , six days in hell , you get the seventh day free .
and it really seemed like my concerns of the previous day vanishing .
the founding mother of the blog revolution , movable type &apos;s mena trott , talks about the early days of blogging , when she realized that giving regular people the power to share our lives online is the key to building a friendlier , more connected world .
children with cleft palates will get it , and they document their story . this is wonderful .
this is mena , this is how i make a joke at people .
norman rockwell hangs in living rooms and bathrooms , and this is not something to be considered high art . &quot;
but then you also find people &apos;s blogs , and those are the records of people who are writing daily -- not necessarily about the same topic , but things that interest them .
there was a joke , originally , about my graph that i left out , which is : you see all this math ? i &apos;m just happy i was able to add it up to 100 , because that &apos;s my skill set .
and that was amazing -- to be able to know that we had empowered that , and that blogging was something that she felt comfortable doing , and that the idea that blogging doesn &apos;t have to be scary , that we don &apos;t always have to be attack of the blogs , that we can be people who are open , and wanting to help and talk to people .
so , how do we make and understand metaphors ?
if you &apos;re like most people , you will experience a moment of cognitive dissonance when the name of the color is printed in a differently colored ink .
each of which was designed to trigger a different historical analogy : world war ii , vietnam , and the third was historically neutral .
stories that offer transformation , that lean into transcendence , but that are never sentimental , that never look away from the darkest things about us .
it &apos;s totally rad . &quot;
and i remember years later , i was writing about my mother , and i asked her , &quot; why did you cry then ? &quot;
so , this guy comes with me .
and father mcgetrick was completely unflustered , just stirred his tea and looked at my mother and said , &quot; it &apos;s all right daphne , i &apos;m scottish . &quot;
and their wish would then be brought to a priest , who would find a ritual object , and the appropriate sacrifices would be made , and the shrine would be built for the god .
in fact , they make their livings on this kind of stuff .
and it wasn &apos;t long before other sites like fark and boing boing and the rest of the internet started saying , &quot; yes ! we love splashy pants . &quot;
and this is kind of how the internet works .
i mean , einstein and mozart and tesla would all be probably diagnosed as autistic spectrum today .
my mind works like google for images .
and the way i sold livestock jobs is i showed off my drawings , i showed off pictures of things .
now , another thing is the sensory issues .
in other words , categorize equipment problem from a people problem .
i was a goofball student . when i was in high school i just didn &apos;t care at all about studying , until i had mr. carlock &apos;s science class .
i &apos;m seeing too many of these smart kids who haven &apos;t learned basic things , like how to be on time .
and this brings up mentors .
but if there is someone here who has an autistic child , or knows an autistic child and feels kind of cut off from them , what advice would you give them ?
and to me , knowledge is something that is extremely valuable . so , maybe , over 10 years ago now our library got flooded .
and that psychological barrier of fear had worked for so many years , and here comes the internet , technology , blackberry , sms .
he was a middle-class guy .
the tunisian experiment , as amir was saying , inspired all of us , showed us that there is a way .
we &apos;re going to win because we don &apos;t have an agenda .
i studied yoga for many years with a teacher named swami satchidananda and people would say , &quot; what are you , a hindu ? &quot; he &apos;d say , &quot; no , i &apos;m an undo . &quot;
and the following year they sent me this one , which i thought was kind of funny .
what was the biggest selling drug of all time when it was introduced a few years ago ?
now , one way to eat fewer calories is to eat less food , which is why you can lose weight on any diet if you eat less food , or if you restrict entire categories of foods .
three grams a day . they come in one-gram capsules ; more than that just gives you extra fat you don &apos;t need .
we could randomly divide them into two groups , and then we could have one group that is a non-intervention control group to compare to , which we can &apos;t do with , say , breast cancer , because everyone gets treated .
it was a nurturing , loving environment , where they were encouraged to let down their emotional defenses and talk about how awful it is to have breast cancer with people who understood , because they were going through it too .
and if they do so , then , of course , the conditions improve , and they start riding on scooters .
well they didn &apos;t build that . they built a proper car . nano .
the mechanism of helicopters seats and windows was used , by the way , as well as a dashboard that was inspired by two-wheelers .
and the title of my talk was therefore &quot; indian innovation from gandhi to gandhian engineering . &quot;
&quot; did it hurt ? &quot;
let &apos;s start in the spirit of more from less and more for more and start putting some targets .
and mind you , it is not getting just a little more for just a little less .
and that is why the message is that of gandhian engineering .
but then he held it for a little while , lakshmi .
he is splendidly attired in his 68,000-dollar uniform , befitting the role of the french academy as legislating the correct usage in french and perpetuating the language .
or , &quot; give a mouse a muffin , &quot; the double-object dative .
well , there are a number of interesting conclusions , i think , from this and many similar kinds of analyses of hundreds of english verbs .
and i &apos;ll start out with a puzzle , the puzzle of indirect speech acts .
in dating , the transition from friendship to sex can lead to , notoriously , various forms of awkwardness , and as can sex in the workplace , in which we call the conflict between a dominant and a sexual relationship &quot; sexual harassment . &quot;
so you get the best of both worlds .
and out of that , you get the need for the kind of things that jimmy was talking about , which is our new kinds of organization , or a better way to put it : how do we organize ourselves without organizations ?
it will be worked out in use , in collaboration with users .
more knowledgeable consumers , more educated , more able to connect with one another , more able to do things together .
that is why the competition with microsoft is bound to come -- will only come -- from an open-source kind of project .
what &apos;s the role of the bbc , for instance , in that world ?
one option : you can create a new character , right from scratch , but with none of the history of your player .
this is about 100 trillion gallons of crude oil still to be developed and produced in the world today .
here &apos;s a piece of limestone .
here &apos;s a piece of coal .
and we need six to eight waist-high plants per person .
those two countries aren &apos;t getting along these days .
and i started freaking out , because i don &apos;t know what kind of crap my grandfather was into .
and a few months before that , there was a white american guy in austin , texas who flew his airplane into the irs building , and i happened to be in austin that day doing a stand-up comedy show .
for example , dubai -- cool place .
&quot; you take a taxi . you go to zara . make a left . &quot;
and what do i mean by that ?
he just wants to wish her a good day , because that &apos;s the start of her day .
but basically , when you walked into those buildings , the private sphere was left behind you .
in my own research , we saw that the peak for private email is actually 11 o &apos;clock in the morning , whatever the country .
now up until that moment , i would have thought that , by age 50 , one of the life skills that i had really nailed was tying my shoes .
this is alex , the best computer voice i &apos;ve been able to find , which comes as standard equipment on every macintosh .
so thank you , leonard cohen , for saving my life .
does that create a separation or a distance from one person to the next ?
it still needs improvement , but at least it sounds like me and not like hal 9000 .
for almost all of its millions and billions of years , there was no life on earth at all .
ce : all of this has happened in the blink of an eye .
it is human nature to look at someone like me and assume i have lost some of my marbles .
because of the rush of human knowledge , because of the digital revolution , i have a voice , and i do not need to scream .
it &apos;s really been a long time since we &apos;ve known about fusion .
fusion is very hard to do .
helium splits out , and a neutron comes out and lots of energy comes out .
the big thing , on the right , is the lithium we have in the world .
it turns out you can &apos;t do fusion on a table top despite all that cold fusion nonsense . right ?
and he pointed up to the sky , and he said , &quot; look , do you see that ?
i &apos;m the &quot; why &quot; guy . i want to know why you do what you do .
but also , i &apos;m looking to see what is it that &apos;s shaping that person &apos;s ability to contribute , to do something beyond themselves . so maybe the real question is , you know , i look at life and say , there &apos;s two master lessons .
thanks for the interaction on a high level there .
but i appreciated the energy , i &apos;ll tell you that .
we all have had time .
control everybody ? develop a skill ? give up ? smoke a cigarette ?
if you don &apos;t raise your hand , you &apos;ll have had other shit too , come on .
next year eight . i wasn &apos;t doing it for brownie points , but after eight , i thought , shit , i could use some help .
her friend , her new boyfriend , wanted to marry her , and she said no .
vik muniz : art with wire , sugar , chocolate and string
on my way out , i had to break a fight apart .
the rocking podium .
it had a physicality , and you start going deeper and deeper into sort of narrative that goes this way , towards the image . so this is &quot; monkey with leica . &quot;
so they &apos;re called &quot; pictures of chocolate . &quot;
but then , just doing the models , i was trying to explore the relationship between the model and the original .
well , i think that &apos;s it .
and that same year , 10 years ago , i headed north to the phoenix islands .
the average depths are about 12,000 ft .
well they exist in the republic of kiribati , and kiribati is located in the central pacific in three island groups .
so i started contacting them -- because they had actually given me a permit to do this -- and i said , &quot; i want to come up and tell you what we found . &quot;
so i went to conservation international and brought them in as a partner and went through the process of valuing the fishery resource , deciding how much kiribati should be compensated , what the range of the fishes were , brought in a whole bunch of other partners -- the government of australia , the government of new zealand , the world bank .
kiribati has frozen extracting activities at its current state while we raise the endowment .
you go into these booths , you interview your grandmother or relative , you leave with a copy of the interview and an interview goes into the library of congress .
so , for example , you can click on this individual lion head , and this is where it originated from , 1300 b.c .
this image in particular really captured our attention at the time , because it so much sums up that event .
this is the so-called slurry wall .
and so when you go to the memorial , you can actually see the overarching organization inside of the individual pools themselves .
and get this -- you &apos;ll have an eight-week vacation of doing absolutely nothing .
the question is : why are we still in afghanistan one decade later ?
because this isn &apos;t the 1990s anymore .
and mullah mustafa -- he &apos;s the man with the pen and paper -- explained that the man sitting immediately to the left as you look at the photograph , nadir shah had bet him that he couldn &apos;t hit me .
and you &apos;ll be delighted to hear in 2011 , today , that guido westerwelle , the german foreign minister , assures us that we are in the &quot; decisive year . &quot;
and thirdly , we need to have some humility .
this is the wrong way of looking at it .
we put our toes in and we go up to our neck .
first of all , we wanted small schools -- about 300 , 400 pupils -- 14 to 19 year-olds , and critically , about 80 percent of the curriculum done not through sitting in classrooms , but through real-life , practical projects , working on commission to businesses , ngo &apos;s and others .
and my hope is that some of you out there may be able to help us .
a long time ago , back in the early 1900s , museums were out looking for dinosaurs .
and in fact , he used the cassowary as an example .
so it &apos;s real easy to tell them apart .
but they did look at these three and they said , &quot; these are three different dinosaurs , and dracorex is probably the most primitive of them .
there &apos;s a triceratops in every museum in the world , but no one had ever collected a juvenile .
and everybody says , &quot; a triceratops and a torosaurus can &apos;t possibly be the same animal because one of them &apos;s bigger than the other one . &quot;
so it must be true -- they must be different . &quot;
magnetic electronic pieces and ferrous paper .
this is a european society with literate records , so we know a good deal about the people and their motivation .
easter , of all pacific islands , has the least input of dust from asia restoring the fertility of its soils . but that &apos;s a factor that we didn &apos;t even appreciate until 1999 .
&lt; speaker &gt; morley &lt; / speaker &gt;
neither can attack the other , because to attack the other side you &apos;ve got to come down the mountain into the valley and then up the other side , and you &apos;re completely exposed .
instead of a weapon , just this shepherd &apos;s staff , and he says -- he &apos;s insulted -- &quot; am i a dog that you would come to me with sticks ? &quot;
if you go back over the history of ancient warfare , you will find time and time again that slingers were the decisive factor against infantry in one kind of battle or another .
and then there &apos;s this whole weird thing about how long it takes goliath to react to the sight of david .
because he can &apos;t make his way on his own .
some of it is controlled , like music or theater , but most of it is chaotic and incoherent , which some of us refer to as noise .
but here &apos;s a picture of lincoln meadow taken after , and you can see that from the perspective of the camera or the human eye , hardly a stick or a tree appears to be out of place , which would confirm the logging company &apos;s contention that there &apos;s nothing of environmental impact .
yeah . well .
this device would automatically send the intended person the letter as an email .
and we made them react to people , but we found that people were being quite playful and childlike with them .
because if that circle weren &apos;t there , and the floor was very even , it would start to wander about in the space .

and the countries on the right hand side , you &apos;ll see the per capita gdp , basically every country with a per capita gdp of , say , less than 5,000 dollars , has got a corruption score of roughly , what &apos;s that , about three ?
boom ! india began to explode .
jimmy wales : the birth of wikipedia
so this is where we get to yochai &apos;s discussion .
the media has covered this somewhat extensively .
we should merely report on what reputable parties have said about it .
of course , it &apos;s my job to say that , but it &apos;s actually true .
somebody says , &quot; i &apos;ve found it on imdb . keep , keep , keep . &quot;
i was describing this in berlin once and the next day in the newspaper the headline said , &quot; i am the queen of england . &quot;
it strikes me that much of the textbooks that are used to educate our children are inherently biased .
our cars are very quickly going to start driving themselves , which means we &apos;re going to need fewer truck drivers .
and artists who were formerly constrained can now do things that were never , ever possible for them before .
to tell you the kinds of societal challenges that are going to come up in the new machine age , i want to tell a story about two stereotypical american workers .
the robots are not going to take all of our jobs in the next year or two , so the classic econ 101 playbook is going to work just fine : encourage entrepreneurship , double down on infrastructure , and make sure we &apos;re turning out people from our educational system with the appropriate skills .
i think we &apos;re going to do something a lot better for one very straightforward reason : the facts are getting out there .
and they were moving and grinding and moving their arms up and down each other .
you see these cars that drive up -- usually it &apos;s saabs and audis and volvos , because in certain neighborhoods it &apos;s socially acceptable to have a luxury car , so long as it comes from a country hostile to u.s. foreign policy -- that &apos;s fine .
and so one way to formulate that is the human mind can take in millions of pieces of information a minute , of which it can be consciously aware of about 40 .
and so let me list just a couple of the things i think this research points us toward trying to understand .
one of my colleagues at the times did a great story about soldiers in iraq who could look down a street and detect somehow whether there was an ied , a landmine , in the street .
i realized that , though carol had died , that core piece of her had not died at all , but had lived on very determinedly in my brain . &quot;
and then there was luke , who washed the floor in a comatose young man &apos;s room twice because the man &apos;s father , who had been keeping a vigil for six months , didn &apos;t see luke do it the first time , and his father was angry .
it &apos;s a story about lemonade .
what else , after all , is there ?
if you have one reason for doing something and i give you a second reason for doing the same thing , it seems only logical that two reasons are better than one and you &apos;re more likely to do it .
acknowledge , when you go to law school , that a little voice is whispering in your ear about atticus finch .
because the truth is that any work that you do that involves interaction with other people is moral work .
this kind of wisdom is within the grasp of each and every one of us if only we start paying attention .
first , we have the fast rise in uganda and zimbabwe .
it is only by stopping the transmission that the world will be able to deal with it .
the ones with the highest income , the better off -- i wouldn &apos;t say rich -- they have higher hiv .
after all , if you are completely healthy and you have heterosexual sex , the risk of infection in one intercourse is one in 1,000 .
that part of the relationship went fine .
this person rated it a two .
that &apos;s the nature of any creative activity .

so you &apos;re the first human being to officially emulate a gecko .
we said , &quot; well , what do tails do ? &quot;
if you make it slip a huge amount , this is what we discovered .
there it is .
it &apos;s unbelievable .
i just did something i &apos;ve never done before .
now a far more relevant question -- as mit physicist evelyn fox keller puts it -- is , &quot; what if those scientists are right ? &quot;
the flipside of this is that constantly being told that you are gifted , chosen and born to rule has distinct societal downsides .
now the problem is that the story was always a lie .
then , you rip off the topsoil and get at that oily sand .
an escape hatch has been reached .
but it was an exciting experience .
except , if you look a little bit closer , you see , in fact , that this thing is way too small to be anything like that .
and the result is kind of a tree of life of these viruses , a phylogeny that looks very much like the type of life that we &apos;re used to , at least on the viral level .
so i &apos;m going to show you a movie where you &apos;re going to see that kind of dynamic .
they all have their own type of frequency distribution , but it &apos;s robust .
the avidians being the denizens of this computer world where they are perfectly happy replicating and growing in complexity .
and now what i did there is , i was being nasty , i just turned up the heat again and again .
jonas gahr støre : in defense of dialogue
but still we have a large deficit in dealing with and understanding modern conflict .
this is tahrir square .
we will make the road from violent activities into politics harder to travel .
all of a sudden , ngos were not only standing in the streets , crying their slogans , but they were taking &#91; them &#93; into the negotiations , partly because they represented the victims of these weapons .
and i learned the hard way , the value of sleep .
thank you so much .
indeed , the person we call fibonacci was actually named leonardo of pisa , and these numbers appear in his book &quot; liber abaci , &quot; which taught the western world the methods of arithmetic that we use today .
now , as much fun as it is to discover these patterns , it &apos;s even more satisfying to understand why they are true .
openness . it &apos;s a word that denotes opportunity and possibilities .
now , i think , in fact , we &apos;re at a turning point in human history , where we can finally now rebuild many of the institutions of the industrial age around a new set of principles .
the market value of his company goes from 90 million to 10 billion dollars , and i can tell you , because he &apos;s my neighbor , he &apos;s a happy camper .
and there are all kinds of famous stories about this .
social media didn &apos;t create the revolution ; it was created by a new generation of young people who wanted jobs and hope and who didn &apos;t want to be treated as subjects anymore .
people started to learn about things , and when they did , the institutions of feudal society appeared to be stalled , or frozen , or failing .
well , the murmuration functions to record a number of principles , and they &apos;re basically the principles that i have described to you today .
it has the frequency of roughly 12 cycles per minute .
they are losing up to 30 percent of their business with people leaving shops faster , or just turning around on the door .
that &apos;s an order of magnitude , up or down .
derartu tulu was ready to hang it up and retire from the sport , but she decided she &apos;d go for broke and try for one last big payday in the marquee event , the new york city marathon .
when you have someone who is more competitive and more compassionate than anybody else in the race , again , it &apos;s not a coincidence .
in other words , early humans are eating dead animals -- no argument , that &apos;s a fact .
a couple years ago , emily baer signed up for a race called the hardrock 100 , which tells you all you need to know about the race .
well if that &apos;s true , a couple other things had to be true as well .
how do we spoil it ? well how do we spoil anything ?
so you burn off the haagen-dazs from the night before ?
you can see this most clearly when you take away someone &apos;s watch and you shut them into a bunker , deep underground , for a couple of months .
have you ever wondered why extremism seems to have been on the rise in muslim-majority countries over the course of the last decade ?
but having been born in essex , at the age of 16 , i joined an organization .
and on the flip side , we have transnational islamist extremists doing the same thing across their own societies .
so these symbols and these leaders come to your mind immediately .
when talking about those reasons , let &apos;s break down certain preconceptions .
that doesn &apos;t guarantee that what comes next will be a society built on democratic values .
and in some areas , the commercial gifting of an organ in exchange for monetary reward has led to a flourishing trade in living , unrelated donors .
and as it turns out , fat is one of the best sources of adult stem cells .
stem cells may be used to deliver growth factors to repair damaged heart muscle or be differentiated into heart muscle cells to restore heart function .
so he designed and went and started a village science program .
if you look at the hexagon , for instance , it &apos;s like an amoeba , which is constantly changing its own profile .
now this was -- you make a joint of six , you make an icosahedron .
well in terms of -- if you were in andhra pradesh , you would make this with the palmyra leaf .

this program started with 16 schools and spread to 1,500 government schools .
and what a blind child can do is to just draw this .
this is worthy of sachin tendulkar .
so that &apos;s a ship .
however , undeterred due to my teenage optimism -- — i went online to a teenager &apos;s two best friends , google and wikipedia .
so instead , i decided to go for a lab .
theories can be shared , and you don &apos;t have to be a professor with multiple degrees to have your ideas valued .
the usa .
i like to think of it as a mesh of civilizations , in which the strands of different cultures are intertwined .
because using ammonia you get hugely high pressures if you heated them wrong .
and they said , &quot; well , there &apos;s no shortage of politicians , no one really minds what happens to them and , after all , there are some things that rats just won &apos;t do . &quot;
you weren &apos;t in charge of policing , justice , education , health , welfare .
we &apos;re going to make every contract -- we &apos;re announcing this today -- available on the internet so anyone can see what the terms are , what the conditions are , driving huge value for money , but also huge increases , i believe , in well-being as well .
how do we make it happen ?

this boy is called zenola .
all right , a political scientist , it doesn &apos;t really count , but my laboratory was the laboratory of democracy that is michigan , and , like any good scientist , i was experimenting with policy about what would achieve the greatest good for the greatest number .
i went from high school to factory .
in fact , i was in china to see what they were doing , and they were putting on a dog-and-pony show for the group that i was with , and i was standing in the back of the room during one of the demonstrations and standing next to one of the chinese officials , and we were watching , and he says , &quot; so , gov , when do you think the u.s. is going to get national energy policy ? &quot;
so you could wait and go through congress , although you should be very impatient .
if everybody on the planet lived the way we did , we &apos;d need between five , six , seven , some people even say 10 planets to make it .

this is a cassette tape the girl puts into her cassette-tape player .
i &apos;m thinking the southwest corner of 5th and 42nd at noon tomorrow , but i &apos;ll stay until you show up , ponytail or not .
think about it , a lie has no power whatsoever by its mere utterance .
if you don &apos;t want to be deceived , you have to know , what is it that you &apos;re hungry for ?
think dante , shakespeare , the bible , news of the world .
so what i &apos;m going to do is i &apos;m going to show you two patterns of deception .
well guess what , they &apos;re known to freeze their upper bodies when they &apos;re lying .
and what a trained interrogator does is they come in and in very subtle ways over the course of several hours , they will ask that person to tell that story backwards , and then they &apos;ll watch them squirm , and track which questions produce the highest volume of deceptive tells .
and for that reason , it &apos;s very , very hard to recover from .
what you want to look for here is an incredible discrepancy between horrific events that she describes and her very , very cool demeanor .
when you combine the science of recognizing deception with the art of looking , listening , you exempt yourself from collaborating in a lie .
now open your eyes .
do you have your ring as well ?
hold out your hand for me . watch it kind of closely .
you &apos;re going to get it eventually . i have faith in you .
so -- -- that &apos;s rather strange . they have shots for that .
now you would expect , given that , that they would choose an alternate route around the sirens , but instead odysseus says , &quot; i want to hear that song .
because there &apos;s two heads inside one person when you think about it .
tying yourself to the mast is the oldest one , but there are other ones such as locking a credit card away with a key or not bringing junk food into the house so you won &apos;t eat it or unplugging your internet connection so you can use your computer .
you say , &quot; well , of course i can &apos;t write today , because i &apos;m giving a tedtalk and i have five media interviews , and then i &apos;m going to a cocktail party and then i &apos;ll be drunk after that .
being down at the bottom means that you &apos;re struggling to make ends meet .
here we see the face of the young subject on the left .
there are programs you can get to see how people might look if they smoke , if they get too much exposure to the sun , if they gain weight and so on .
and in places where you wouldn &apos;t think , such as south korea , india and china , the very strict patriarchal societies are starting to break down a little , and families are no longer strongly preferring first-born sons .
that particular headline comes to me from a market research firm .
we used to have a manufacturing economy , which was about building goods and products , and now we have a service economy and an information and creative economy .
well it turns out that they &apos;re just very uncomfortable doing that .
now you laugh , but that quote has kind of a sting to it , right ?
now they &apos;ve been asking a question since 1985 : &quot; how strongly do you prefer a first-born son ? &quot;
it &apos;s definitely terrifying to stand at the foot of a high bridge , but it &apos;s also pretty exhilarating , because it &apos;s beautiful up there , and you &apos;re looking out on a beautiful view .
i &apos;m already beyond the lifespan of most hunter-gatherers , and the outcome of a mortal combat between me myopically stumbling around with a stone-tipped spear and an enraged giant aurochs isn &apos;t very hard to predict .
the wolves killed coyotes , and as a result of that , the number of rabbits and mice began to rise , which meant more hawks , more weasels , more foxes , more badgers .
they tell us that when you take away the large animals , you are left with a radically different ecosystem to one which retains its large animals .
in europe , for example , they evolved to resist the straight-tusked elephant , elephas antiquus , which was a great beast .
he made that special effect at the beginning to get everyone to think about interconnection and interconnectedness and how everything in life was totally interconnected .
you can experience yourself as the other beings when you see through the delusion of being separated from them .
i think the dalai lama should have heard that . i wish he &apos;d been there to hear that .
but he could memorize all the needs of all the beings that he is , he will , he did .
a few years ago , i did a meditation retreat in thailand .
and there &apos;s different text .
but in another sense , it &apos;s an incredibly complicated object that we need relatively exotic physics to describe , and in some sense represents the breakdown of our physical understanding of the universe .
and since the mass determines the schwarzschild radius , there is actually only one thing i really need to know .
it &apos;s way more energetic .
if there were no massive objects these things would go flying off , or at least go at a much slower rate because all that determines how they go around is how much mass is inside its orbit .
so , it &apos;s kind of like very fancy eyeglasses for your telescope .
and the truth is , i &apos;m not quite there .
there is a dearth of old stars .
ryan lobo : photographing the hidden story
today many of these children are addicted to drugs like heroin , and they are destitute , like these young men in the image .
this man was very drunk , and he was very interested in my camera , until he noticed the women , who handled him with smiles , and ak-47s at the ready , of course .
and this is something that is common to all our big cities .
when we see these little dips in the light , we can determine a number of things .
thank you .
since i was a student , i wanted to open up better opportunities to other kids in gando .

it wasn &apos;t two years ago that everybody was talking about -- we &apos;ve found the holy grail of biology .
it &apos;s changing our lives in so many ways , and it will continue to do that .
we look the same to a visitor from another planet , maybe , but not to each other because we compete with each other all time .
but there are more important things that are already occurring : embryo screening .
the lines are going to blur . and they already are between therapy and enhancement , between treatment and prevention , between need and desire .
and that &apos;s where about half of our drugs come .
and what &apos;s extraordinary is that we &apos;re not just observing this , we are the architects of this .
two-thirds of all students in special ed. remedial programs are guys .
and there &apos;s some guy watching a hundred , obviously .
and this is a rainy election day in a small country -- that can be my country , but could be also your country .
and i &apos;ll start with what went right .
remember , until the 1970s , the spread of democracy has always been accompanied by the decline of inequality .
you have facebook revolutions , twitter revolutions .
and i do believe that when we &apos;re discussing politics these days , probably it makes sense to look also at this type of a story .
i &apos;m looking for a third way : i &apos;m preparing to get alzheimer &apos;s disease .
and i &apos;m teaching myself to knit , which so far i can knit a blob .
i need to make a confession at the outset here .
the key is to overcome what &apos;s called functional fixedness .
this is one of the most robust findings in social science , and also one of the most ignored .
this is a fact -- or , as we say in my hometown of washington , d.c. , a true fact .
management did not emanate from nature .
autonomy , mastery and purpose , these are the building blocks of a new way of doing things .
gayle tzemach lemmon : women entrepreneurs , example not exception

we use a modified inkjet printer , and we print geometry .
and all of a sudden , out of the dark , from the other end of the square , i saw the glint of mirrors lit by the moon .
if i were to reduce this entire story into one image , what would it be ? &quot;
so i could go from -- for instance , i &apos;ll show you some &quot; spider-man &quot; later , these incredible machines that move people along .
and i , the king , shall love thee .
it &apos;s real , what &apos;s happening .
i know you &apos;ve all been there .
so for the next two years , that &apos;s what i did .
and this idea of creating a safe haven for our kids and getting to know exactly what they &apos;re going through , getting to know their families -- i wanted that , but i couldn &apos;t do it in a school with 1,600 kids , and teachers turning over year after year after year .
journalist mustafa akyol talks about the way that some local cultural practices have become linked , in the popular mind , to the articles of faith of islam . has the world &apos;s general idea of the islamic faith focused too much on tradition , and not enough on core beliefs ?
first of all , muslims -- pious , conservative , believing muslims who want to be loyal to their religion -- should not cling onto everything in their culture , thinking that that &apos;s divinely mandated .
now these are some of the questions i had in mind a few years ago when i sat down to write a book .
similarly , in the arab world , there was what the great arab historian albert hourani defines as the liberal age .
turkey has never been colonized , so it remained as an independent nation after the fall of the ottoman empire .
your smartphone may feel like a friend -- but a true friend would give you a smile once in a while . at ted2013 , keller rinaudo demos romo , the smartphone-powered mini robot who can motor along with you on a walk , slide you a cup of coffee across the table , and react to you with programmable expressions .
so i can see everything that romo sees , and i get a robot &apos;s-eye-view of the world .
thanks , scott .
well recently , i led an airborne mapping campaign in the kruger national park in south africa .
so our imagery is 3d , it &apos;s chemical , it &apos;s biological , and this tells us not only the species that are living in the canopy , but it tells us a lot of information about the rest of the species that occupy the rainforest .
unfortunately , most of the carbon is lost in the lowlands , but what you see that &apos;s left , in terms of high carbon stocks in greens and reds , is the stuff that &apos;s up in the mountains .
and in this case , we found gold mining activity , all of it illegal , set back away from the river &apos;s edge , as you &apos;ll see in those strange pockmarks coming up on your screen on the right .

and again , there were people who laughed at me and said , &quot; don &apos;t be crazy choosing such a tough curriculum for these students .
vocational skill program for the older siblings so the younger ones are not stopped from coming to school .
it is not the infrastructure , not the toilets , not the libraries , but it is what actually happens in this school that is more important .
thank you .

the next day , all the artists were invited to join mandela in robben island , where he was going to give a conference to the world &apos;s press , standing in front of his former prison cell .
a lot of the funding that i have managed to raise has gone directly to treatment action campaign and the incredible work that they do , and are still continuing to do in south africa .
this is avelile -- she goes with me wherever i go .
now as you ponder that question , maybe you &apos;re thinking about the first day of preschool or kindergarten , the first time that kids are in a classroom with a teacher .
a study published last year found that from birth , from the moment of birth , babies cry in the accent of their mother &apos;s native language .
the fetus incorporates these offerings into its own body , makes them part of its flesh and blood .
in other words , the mothers with post-traumatic stress syndrome had passed on a vulnerability to the condition to their children while they were still in utero .
well , this is what happens when you pair people up at random .
in the book , i go over controversies such as this one , and a number of other hot buttons , hot zones , chernobyls , third rails , and so on -- including the arts , cloning , crime , free will , education , evolution , gender differences , god , homosexuality , infanticide , inequality , marxism , morality , nazism , parenting , politics , race , rape , religion , resource depletion , social engineering , technological risk and war .
the telling of stories , music , dance , poetry -- found in all cultures , and many of the motifs and themes that give us pleasure in the arts can be found in all human societies : a preference for symmetrical forms , the use of repetition and variation , even things as specific as the fact that in poetry all over the world , you have lines that are very close to three seconds long , separated by pauses .
and here &apos;s just one example .
until the studies are redone with adoptive children , who provide an environment but not genes to their kids , we have no way of knowing whether these conclusions are valid .
and he said that he could actually see an x-ray of his fingers , because the light was so bright .
this morning , the temperature of the english channel was 18 degrees .
and it was -- the paradox is that you &apos;re in freezing cold water , but actually you &apos;re on fire .
and all i could think of was , if that happened to ran after three minutes , and i can &apos;t feel my hands after five minutes , what on earth is going to happen if i try 20 minutes ?
narrator : we &apos;re just sailing out of harbor now , and it &apos;s at this stage when one can have a bit of a wobble mentally .
the first thing we need to do is we need to break this problem down into manageable chunks .
it sounded interesting . he asked me to go and shave .
and when we run experiments , we usually hope that one group will behave differently than another .
but this was not the case .
in fact , while we drove 140,000 miles , people didn &apos;t even notice .
ideally , you would not be satisfied until you had actually done the work .
and my family and friends had gathered there to hear me speak .
and so i argued with people about that , i argued and i argued .
now during that time -- those 17 years -- i walked and i played the banjo and i painted and i wrote in my journal , and i tried to study the environment by reading books .
you &apos;re going to go to south america , aren &apos;t you ? &quot;
and so what came to me is , if you were a teacher and you were teaching , if you weren &apos;t learning you probably weren &apos;t teaching very well .
i wrote regulations for the united states -- i mean , i wrote oil spill regulations .
i didn &apos;t get shot .
because we are the environment , and how we treat each other is really how we &apos;re going to treat the environment .
i mean , probability and statistics , it &apos;s the mathematics of games and gambling .
so , if we run this program , this is what we get .
you know , in working on this science for many years , i kept wondering , &quot; what will be its first killer app ? &quot;
you know , we have an ldl level of 140 for a male aged 50 .
on the one hand , we have mathematica , with its sort of precise , formal language and a huge network of carefully designed capabilities able to get a lot done in just a few lines .
so , with physical materials , we &apos;re used to going around the world and discovering that particular materials are useful for particular technological purposes .
one &apos;s got to build a structure that &apos;s probably at least as deep as existing physics .
stephen wolfram , thank you .

okay . i am known as captain organic , and that &apos;s a philosophical position as well as an aesthetic position .
it &apos;s a seductor , but i just feel in my bones that that &apos;s possible .
when i look at these things , they look pretty normal to me .
it &apos;s the world &apos;s first chair made in magnesium .
in his day , he was the highest taxpayer in britain .
it &apos;s grown in my mind , and then it &apos;s grown in terms of the whole process that i go through .
its cars are made from 30,000 components .
this is the data that goes with that . incredibly complex .
this -- sorry -- -- that &apos;s a solar seed . it &apos;s a concept for new architecture .
&lt; speaker &gt; beverly + dereck joubert &lt; / speaker &gt;
and right now this is in the okavango delta in botswana .
but for us to get them , not only do we push ourselves , but we live by certain rules of engagement , which mean we can &apos;t interfere .
these are precious to us , these divides .
but i have to tell you -- everybody always asks , &quot; what happened to the baby baboon ? &quot;
bj : and you have to know that , when a male lion is killed , it completely disrupts the whole pride .
i couldn &apos;t even do the simplest trick , but it was very natural for me , because i was not dextrous , and hated all sports .
&lt; speaker &gt; luca turin &lt; / speaker &gt;
some people have tried in the 1920s to add things from the bad parts , and it didn &apos;t really work .
he &apos;s making 45 molecules , and he &apos;s looking for a sandalwood , something that smells of sandalwood .
the s-h stretch is in the middle of a part of the keyboard that has been , so to speak , damaged , and there are no neighboring notes , nothing is close to it .
now , i could do the dance of electron tunneling , but i &apos;ve done a video instead , which is much more interesting . here &apos;s how it works .
and then you start cranking the computer to find other molecules , related or unrelated , that have the same vibrations .
most people will say , &quot; emotions are terribly hard .
most people are about 60 inches high or more , and there &apos;s these cube laws . so if you make them this big , by using nanotechnology , i suppose -- -- then you could have a thousand times as many .
and nobody knows how hard that is , but we &apos;ll probably find out in a few years .
emotion is not something added to thought . an emotional state is what you get when you remove 100 or 200 of your normally available resources .
well it doesn &apos;t break even .
and the reason it is there is to make sure you , the entity filling out the form , are actually a human and not some sort of computer program that was written to submit the form millions and millions of times .
but then i started thinking , is there any way we can use this effort for something that is good for humanity ?
so the next time you type a captcha , these words that you &apos;re typing are actually words that are coming from books that are being digitized that the computer could not recognize .
here &apos;s another really bad one .
let me tell you about one that i &apos;m most excited about .
even when it doesn &apos;t make a mistake , since it makes so many mistakes , you don &apos;t know whether to trust it or not .
so i don &apos;t even know if there exists 100 million people out there using the web who are bilingual enough to help us translate .
now the crazy thing about this method is that it actually really works .
since all the projects that my group has worked on so far have gotten millions of users , we &apos;re hopeful that we &apos;ll be able to translate extremely fast with this project .
now in most parts of the world , the water &apos;s pretty murky , so it &apos;s very hard to observe animals underwater , but i found a community of dolphins that live in these beautiful , clear , shallow sandbanks of the bahamas which are just east of florida .
for example , males will stimulate a female during a courtship chase .
this underwater keyboard in orlando , florida , at the epcot center , was actually the most sophisticated ever two-way interface designed for humans and dolphins to work together under the water and exchange information .
you have to keep their attention .
and because of this , we really decided we needed some more sophisticated technology .
i spent a lot of time counting beads and things like that .
and so we were commissioned to design a bridge that would open .
and there are 2,000 new homes being built next to this power station .
but the thing that was true , the expo was about the future of cities , and particularly the victorians pioneered integrating nature into the cities .
and inside , the daylight -- each one is an optic and it brings light into the center .
in the projects we &apos;ve been working on , these slick buildings , where they might be a fancy shape , but the materiality feels the same , is something that we &apos;ve been trying to research really , and explore alternatives .
because it &apos;s quite hard to waterproof buildings anyway , but if you say you &apos;re going to drill 66,000 holes in it -- we had quite a time .
so lesson number one : sisyphus .
if nothing else , at least i &apos;ve discovered what it is we put our speakers through : sweaty palms , sleepless nights , a wholly unnatural fear of clocks .
what is going on here ?
so , this possibility of a new type of global recognition , i think , is driving huge amounts of effort .
we spark off each other .
but look at this video .
for the first time in human history , talented students don &apos;t have to have their potential and their dreams written out of history by lousy teachers .
it &apos;s not crazy ; it &apos;s actually happening right now .
and , from my experience , you know , kids are naturally curious about what they don &apos;t know , or don &apos;t understand , or is foreign to them .
curious encounters were happening to me at the time ; i &apos;d been accepting numerous invitations to speak on the design of the cheetah legs around the world .
that &apos;s a good close-up of that one .
&lt; speaker &gt; anna deavere smith &lt; / speaker &gt;
and that voice , without losing a beat , says , &apos; because of late entry , we &apos;re delayed 30 seconds . &apos; just then , everybody &apos;s looking at this couple with hateful eyes and the couple &apos;s going like this , you know , shrinking .
so , talk about risk taking . i &apos;m going to do somebody that nobody likes .
i &apos;m just talking about the particular night that she died .
and we told the security guard what we had put on her and we went home and we dressed her in exactly the same thing that we had told the security guard that we had put on her .
&quot; i used to believe america was the best .
&quot; but i wish that , i wish that , i wish that i could be part of the enjoyment .
i said , &apos; well look , the woman talked to me for four hours .
so i think data can actually make us more human .
moving across to the west coast , you see san francisco and los angeles -- big low-traffic zones across nevada and arizona .
there &apos;s actually a legless man that sits in that box and controls this chess player .
there were 662 rejected sheep that didn &apos;t meet &quot; sheep-like &quot; criteria and were thrown out of the flock .
so we took a hundred dollar bill and divided it into 10,000 teeny pieces , and we fed those into the mechanical turk .
and then you &apos;d do your best to recreate that with your own voice .
the lyrics to the leading track are &quot; ain &apos;t no grave can hold my body down . &quot;
so this isn &apos;t finished at all , but it &apos;s an ongoing project where people can continue to collaborate .
what &apos;s the key to using alternative energy , like solar and wind ? storage -- so we can have power on tap even when the sun &apos;s not out and the wind &apos;s not blowing . in this accessible , inspiring talk , donald sadoway takes to the blackboard to show us the future of large-scale batteries that store renewable energy . as he says : &quot; we need to think about the problem differently . we need to think big . we need to think cheap . &quot;
admittedly , i &apos;ve left out a few details .
today , we can produce virgin metal from ore at a cost of less than 50 cents a pound .
so what to do next ?
and one variant of the technology has us stacking these bistro tabletops into modules , aggregating the modules into a giant battery that fits in a 40-foot shipping container for placement in the field .
anything below eight percent sweetness is not sweet enough ; anything above 12 percent sweetness is too sweet .
and they would say , you know , &quot; move ! next ! &quot;
and he sat them down for two hours , and he gave them , over the course of that two hours , ten bowls .
people don &apos;t know what they want ! right ?
takes over the mustard business !
which were thin , and you just put a little bit over it and it sunk down to the bottom of the pasta .
the guys says he &apos;s looking for his keys .
we have paper forms to track people who come into clinics .
now 1995 , obviously that was quite a long time ago .
and unfortunately , after thinking about this for some time , i realized -- i identified the main obstacle .
they started using linkedin and flickr and gmail and google maps , all these things .
now it &apos;s real time , and because this is such a low-cost system and based in the cloud , it costs , for the entire five countries that camfed runs this in with tens of thousands of girls , the whole cost combined is 10,000 dollars a year .
by contrast , years of marketing have taught me that if you actually want people to remember you and to appreciate what you do , the most potent things are actually very , very small .
so what happens in an institution is the very person who has the power to solve the problem also has a very , very large budget .
the last thing in the world you ever want to see is your balance . &quot;
and i &apos;d be wrong to dis that completely .
he has been orphaned , as both of his parents died of aids , and his grandmother took care of him until he too died of aids .
adam and eve one day in the garden of eden realize they are naked .
of course , the accuracy keeps getting worse .
and then they create , in real time , a facial composite of these two friends .
in fact , i want to share with you the fact that there are alternatives .
however , in the book , he also offers us a way out of that society , similar to the path that adam and eve had to follow to leave the garden .
i needed something to take me out of my pain , an objective to look forward to .
so through the marathon , we learned that political problems can be overcome .
but i do hope to take you to some places you &apos;ve never been to before .
so dai manju basically finished out middle school .
how many of you think -- a few -- how many of you there are more females in the world ?
so research has shown , if you look at people who live under two dollars a day -- one metric of poverty -- two percent of that take-home pay goes to this basket here , in education .
we don &apos;t have to expect a world where girls are bought and sold or killed .
so now , mahabuba , she is saving the lives of hundreds , thousands , of women .
which brings me to the final element , which is education .
there &apos;s bill easterly &apos;s book .
and she realized that she had the great fortune to be born in a country where we take security for granted , where we not only can feed , clothe and house ourselves , but also provide for wild birds so they don &apos;t go hungry in the winter .
it &apos;s exciting to see that in terms of what we &apos;ve learned , but how many of those 4,000 diseases now have treatments available ?
well , let me tell you about a few examples where this has actually worked .
in an experiment done in cell culture and shown here in a cartoon , if you take that particular compound and you add it to that cell that has progeria , and you watch to see what happened , in just 72 hours , that cell becomes , for all purposes that we can determine , almost like a normal cell .
could we , in fact , encourage all the companies that are out there that have drugs in their freezers that are known to be safe in humans but have never actually succeeded in terms of being effective for the treatments they were tried for ?
are those cells happy or not ?
i explored the human skin , and how technology can transform the body .
and i feel like i &apos;ve just got started .
and second , i don &apos;t care about the word , i care about how you use it .
&lt; speaker &gt; seth godin &lt; / speaker &gt;
cities gave them a charter to get rid of the stray animals on the street and destroy them .
henry ford comes up with a really cool idea .
and , unfortunately , it doesn &apos;t work so well anymore either .
and it turns out that it &apos;s tribes -- not money , not factories -- that can change our world , that can change politics , that can align large numbers of people .
but let me just try a couple .
it &apos;s exactly the same behavior though .
my friend red maxwell has spent the last 10 years fighting against juvenile diabetes .
what i want you to do , it only takes 24 hours , is : create a movement .
indeed , the researchers picked this site because ice and snow accumulates here 10 times faster than anywhere else in antarctica .
consider , the single most successful international environmental effort of the 20th century , the montreal protocol , in which the nations of earth banded together to protect the planet from the harmful effects of ozone-destroying chemicals used at that time in air conditioners , refrigerators and other cooling devices .
what happens when the number of vehicles on the road doubles , triples , or even quadruples ?
and as a young boy , i used to go up to northern michigan and fish in the rivers that hemingway fished in and then later wrote about .
today there are about 800 million cars on the road worldwide .
and up above , you &apos;ve got a series of pedestrian walkways .
but as we found out with addressing co2 issues , and also fossil fuels , there is no one silver bullet .
&lt; speaker &gt; john hardy &lt; / speaker &gt;
they &apos;re beautiful . they &apos;re bamboo .
the beautiful canvas and rubber skylights got eaten by the sun in six months .
they took the tapioca roots up to the kitchen , sliced them thinly and made delicious chips .
and people are coming forward from all over the world to support the balinese scholarship fund , because these kids will be bali &apos;s next green leaders .
it may not be the biggest bamboo building in the world , but many people believe that it &apos;s the most beautiful .
for example , if we &apos;d had tedxparis 350 years ago , we would have talked about the military innovation of the day -- the massive vauban-style fortifications -- and we could have predicted a period of stability in the world or in europe .
in may 2009 , general kevin chilton , commander of the u.s. nuclear forces , stated that in the event of cyberattacks against the u.s. , all options would be on the table .
so whenever you talk about africa , you have to put up this picture of the world from space , and people go , &quot; look , it &apos;s the dark continent . &quot;
if you think about the railroad system in north america and how that worked , first came the infrastructure , then came the industry around it , the brothels -- it &apos;s a bit like the internet today , right ? — and everything else that worked with it : bars , saloons , etc .
and by specifying eight different goals , the united nations has said that there are so many things needed to change in a country in order to get the good life for people .
are they alive ?
that &apos;s unfair .
in the 90s , only 1.2 percent , only 1.2 percent .
and eventually , soon they started to get better and better here .
one , two , three , four children per woman : six , seven , eight children per woman .
huh ?
let &apos;s be clear about that .
&quot; and we &apos;d like to go ahead and close this out .
they plow it right back into filing more troll lawsuits .
if you want a printed sugar birthday cake , you have to use one of our prefab images -- only for professionals . &quot;
we do like to consume , but every time one of these new tools came along , it turned out we also like to produce and we like to share .
so in order to fake the ability to sell uncopyable bits , the dmca also made it legal to force you to use systems that broke the copying function of your devices .
imagine this sign everywhere -- except imagine it doesn &apos;t say college bakery , imagine it says youtube and facebook and twitter .
they &apos;re the next turn of this particular screw , which has been going on 20 years now .
and if you can , just scribble a pattern .
and that &apos;s no different from imperial college in london , by the way , it &apos;s not some sort of anti-american thing going on .
and this is nasa &apos;s view . they &apos;re stunningly similar .
for example , we are , in britain , we &apos;re trying to do a digital switchover of the whole population into digital technology &#91; for television &#93; .
and this is truly the most amazing thing in the world .
for one thing they must be involved in things like imitation and emulation .
now , the question then arises : if i simply watch another person being touched , why do i not get confused and literally feel that touch sensation merely by watching somebody being touched ?
imagine a country with abundant power -- oil and gas , sunshine , wind -- but missing one key essential for life : water . infrastructure engineer fahad al-attiya talks about the unexpected ways that the small middle eastern nation of qatar creates its water supply .
my mother has an accent that is so different to my father , and we &apos;re all a population of about 300,000 people in the same country .
not only cities that we &apos;re building , but cities with dreams and people who are wishing to be scientists , doctors .
we only have two days of water reserve .

the median contribution was somewhere around 57 dollars .
then , the french imposed their brilliantly conceived airline tax to create a something called unitaid , got a bunch of other countries to help .
and two , will it do it at a price that will enable the country to sustain a health care system without foreign donors after five to 10 years ?
when we came to this rural area , 45 percent of the children under the age of five had stunted growth due to malnutrition .
it has been an honor for me , particularly , to work in rwanda where we also have a major economic development project in partnership with sir tom hunter , the scottish philanthropist , where last year we , using the same thing with aids drugs , cut the cost of fertilizer and the interest rates on microcredit loans by 30 percent and achieved three- to four-hundred percent increases in crop yields with the farmers .
reading about matthieu was one of the pivotal moments of my life .
another example , three googlers -- a chef , an engineer and , most funny , a massage therapist -- three of them , they learned about a region in india where 200,000 people live without a single medical facility .
and if you look at these qualities in the context of compassion , we find that the cognitive and affective components of compassion -- understanding people and empathizing with people -- inhibits , tones down , what i call the excessive self-obsession that &apos;s in us , therefore creating the conditions for humility .
what does that mean ?
as we move to search , we rely on the relevance rankings , the web matching , the index crawling .
we made it all freely available on the web , just to -- it was obviously our chance of helping out with the cause .

so the outer part of that brain is the neocortex .
this a place where the dead are brought in .
and this is just showing this here -- this frozen tissue , and it &apos;s being cut .
we &apos;re taking over a thousand samples for each brain .
in the side effect profile , etc . , you want to see where those genes are turned on .
it &apos;s this dark purple precipitate within the cell that &apos;s telling us a gene is turned on there .
we are more dependent on it now than ever .
on the next table was a chinese guy , and in the crew room , it was entirely filipinos .
we know about man &apos;s impact on the ocean in terms of fishing and overfishing , but we don &apos;t really know much about what &apos;s happening underneath the water .
she said , &quot; those high notes are going to kill you . &quot;
the pump was a little bit problematic when performing , so i &apos;d attach it to my inner thigh with the help of the girdle and an ace bandage .
finally , with the last bottle in and the last bubble out , i attached the pump to the tubing and lay there hoping it would kick in soon enough .
and they had lungs .
but life isn &apos;t really just about avoiding death , is it ?
we &apos;re roughly two days from the entrance at that point .
and we &apos;ve since gone on to develop many generations of gadgets for exploring places like this .
you need an auv , an autonomous underwater vehicle .
what i &apos;m going to show you next are a couple of controversial ideas .
we can &apos;t do that right now .
we can do it by jump-starting with an industrial lewis and clark expedition to shackleton crater , to mine the moon for resources , and demonstrate they can form the basis for a profitable business on orbit .
anyway , i did have a really big epiphany around the situation , so chris invited me to tell you about it .
this youngest of seven had to get herself to the front of the line .
then i &apos;d tell them , &quot; well , i &apos;m getting my hip replaced -- in 18 months .

domo arigato gozaimashita .
let &apos;s take the example of electrical stimulation .
so wouldn &apos;t it be amazing if our phones could see the world in the same way that we do , as we &apos;re walking around being able to point a phone at anything , and then have it actually recognize images and objects like the human brain , and then be able to pull in information from an almost infinite library of knowledge and experiences and ideas .
mm : awesome . thank you .
okay , so are you all ready ?
let me begin with four words that will provide the context for this week , four words that will come to define this century .
technology is amazing . people are innovative .
now we &apos;ve had 50 years of warnings .
the future is inherently uncertain .
we are smart , in fact , we really are quite amazing , but we do love a good crisis .
well it &apos;s time to grow up , to be wiser , to be calmer , to be more considered .
we have a wingspan of about two meters .
here &apos;s some numbers .
very few cities fail .
and yet , despite all of that darwinian evolution and natural selection , they &apos;ve been constrained to lie on a line .
the slope of that is less than linear .
so if it is those networks and their mathematical structure , unlike biology , which had sublinear scaling , economies of scale , you had the slowing of the pace of life as you get bigger .
in that interpretation , by bureaucracy and administration , and they do it beautifully , may i say .
and most people would go home and feel sure that their vote has been counted , because they trust that the election system works .
and remember , the vote is encrypted from the moment you leave the voting booth , so if an election official wants to find out how you voted , they will not be able to .
they completely interrupt the communication between the brain and the spinal cord , thus leading to complete and permanent paralysis of the leg .
i was completely fascinated by this locomotion without the brain , but at the same time so frustrated .
it occurred throughout the central nervous system , including in the brain stem , where we observed up to 300-percent increase in the density of fibers coming from the brain .
you may think i &apos;m wrong in this , but i think that we live in an age when our lives are regularly punctuated by career crises , by moments when what we thought we knew , about our lives , about our careers , comes into contact with a threatening sort of reality .
we &apos;ve done away with the caste system .
a meritocratic society is one in which if you &apos;ve got talent and energy and skill , you will get to the top . nothing should hold you back .
and he &apos;s going to do that on the day of judgment with angels and trumpets , and the skies will open .
and then my favorite .
here &apos;s an insight that i &apos;ve had about success .
alain de botton : yes . i think it &apos;s merely the randomness of the winning and losing process that i wanted to stress .
do that only if you &apos;re paid by the hour .
david pogue : unfortunately , the carriers didn &apos;t adopt the same keystroke , so it &apos;s different by carrier , so it devolves upon you to learn the keystroke for the person you &apos;re calling .
you get it every time .
this arrest occurred because there was cooperation between the london metropolitan police and the economic and financial crimes commission of nigeria -- led by one of our most able and courageous people : mr. nuhu ribadu .
the second thing i want to talk about is the will for reform .
the smartest one , first to come in , was the mtn company of south africa .
and what is more important , because we want to get away from oil and diversify -- and there are so many opportunities in this one big country , as in many countries in africa -- what was remarkable is that much of this growth came not from the oil sector alone , but from non-oil .
i &apos;m trying to tell you that since the past three years , the average rate of growth on the continent has moved from about 2.5 percent to about five percent per annum .
for 10,000 pieces .
and so the thousands of young muslim men who flocked to afghanistan in the 1980s to fight against the soviet occupation of a muslim country , in their minds they were fighting a jihad , they were doing jihad , and they named themselves the mujahideen , which is a word that comes from the same root as jihad .
that was the power of that word that he was able to do .
i was in yemen recently , where -- it &apos;s the home of the last al qaeda franchise that still aspires to attack america , attack the west .
who killed bin ladenism ? abu musab al-zarqawi killed it .
to that jihad we can say , &quot; goodbye . good riddance . &quot;
but let me go back in time a bit .
robert lepage : &#91; as usual , arthur &apos;s drawing didn &apos;t account for the technical challenges .
and this guy is another guy i admire a lot , and i wanted him to be involved in the movie as a production designer .
well , the conventional approach to post-conflict situations has rested on , on kind of , three principles .
but the objective of facing reality is to change reality .
elections produce a loser , who is then excluded .
in post-conflict situations , the reason that they so often revert to conflict , is not because elderly women get upset .
and to date , there has been a sort of a schizophrenia in the donor community , as to how to build basic services in post-conflict sectors .
paddy ashdown , who was the grand high nabob of bosnia to the united nations , in his book about his experience , he said , &quot; i realize what i needed was accountants without borders , to follow that money . &quot;
i &apos;m going to come back to that in a moment .
a second argument would be : because it was sitting on a stove with the flame on -- that &apos;s an historical argument .
and it &apos;s like the traffic that you see .
so it is very , very simple once you learn how to read it .
now , one of the nice characteristics of simple things is you know what it &apos;s going to do , in general .
it wicks its way up into these little branches .
have you started to do that ?
now i &apos;d love to watch the first movie again as sort of a warm-up to the sequel coming out next week .
what &apos;s happening is the internet is removing the middleman , so that anyone from a t-shirt designer to a knitter can make a living selling peer-to-peer .
i bet , in a couple of years , that phrases like &quot; coworking &quot; and &quot; couchsurfing &quot; and &quot; time banks &quot; are going to become a part of everyday vernacular .
there &apos;s a great quote that was written in the new york times that said , &quot; sharing is to ownership what the ipod is to the 8-track , what solar power is to the coal mine . &quot;
at 7 : 45 a.m. , i open the doors to a building dedicated to building , yet only breaks me down .
so , when you start to think about politicians , you &apos;ve got to realize these are strange creatures .
so , how are you going to write your letter ?
you &apos;re going to do that by the way you sign your letter .
removing the salts from water -- particularly seawater -- through reverse osmosis is a critical technique for countries who do not have access to clean drinking water around the globe .
and with my short time today , i just want to share with you the one story that is probably most responsible for that redefinition .
i &apos;m still dating that guy four years later . &quot;
&lt; speaker &gt; shane koyczan &lt; / speaker &gt;
when i was 14 , i was asked to seriously consider a career path .
like a boomerang , the thing i loved came back to me .
i told her , whenever i &apos;m sad , my grandmother gives me karate chops .
to this day , kids are still being called names .

let &apos;s tell the quad to come back here and let the pole drop , and i will next demonstrate the importance of understanding physical models and the workings of the physical world .
the following calculations are made every 20 milliseconds , or 50 times per second .
whew !
when people don &apos;t take their pills , when people don &apos;t follow doctors &apos; orders -- these are behavior problems .
you &apos;ll eat mush for the rest of your life .
and i had to explain , &quot; they &apos;re trying to scare people . &quot;
the choice in this case is pretty simple .
this is an approach that has been developed by a couple researchers at dartmouth medical school , lisa schwartz and steven woloshin .
so that &apos;s what i want to walk you through .
what you &apos;re actually measuring is spelled out in clean language .
so i want to just offer four questions that every patient should ask , because i don &apos;t actually expect people to start developing these lab test reports .
this graph represents what we &apos;re dealing with now in the built environment .
so our concept is really this back-to-the-future concept , harnessing the intelligence of that land settlement pattern .
so we imagine that we would actually potentially even host a bake sale to start our new project .
but we imagine , with our calculations , that by 2050 , you might be able to sink your teeth into a gowanus oyster .
now this didn &apos;t sound very plausible .
now , this shows that reminding people of death biases them to believe , regardless of the evidence , and it works not just for religion , but for any kind of belief system that promises immortality in some form , whether it &apos;s becoming famous or having children or even nationalism , which promises you can live on as part of a greater whole .
but for others , the whole idea of resurrection , of climbing out of the grave , it &apos;s just too much like a bad zombie movie .
so it was natural for me as a child to fear being swallowed by the void , but it wasn &apos;t rational , because being swallowed by the void is not something that any of us will ever live to experience .
so it &apos;s really quite big .
she is treated with surgery , chemotherapy and radiation .
and it turns out nick shows up at the children &apos;s hospital with this distended belly like a famine victim .
so i just recently had to buy life insurance .
you have bigger clan gatherings and so on .
but , &quot; a very important but , &quot; i love christmas carols .
they said , where are people going to find the morality , where are they going to find guidance , and where are they going to find sources of consolation ?
they &apos;d go , &quot; no , no . i don &apos;t need one of those .
in the secular world we think , &quot; if an idea is important , i &apos;ll bump into it .
and we &apos;d know that we had a real rhythm going .
but that feeling of puzzlement is structural to contemporary art .
and they don &apos;t really change much .
if you &apos;re involved in anything that &apos;s communal , that involves lots of people getting together , there are things for you in religion .
it &apos;s not as though , as i try to suggest , it &apos;s not as though either you have religion and then you have to accept all sorts of things , or you don &apos;t have religion and then you &apos;re cut off from all these very good things .
i &apos;m a gamer , so i like to have goals .
number three : i wish i had let myself be happier .
it said , you &apos;re never going to get better .
but how does it work ?
if you &apos;re inside , find a window and look out of it .
so , the average life expectancy in the u.s. and the u.k. is 78.1 years , but we know from more than 1,000 peer-reviewed scientific studies that you can add 10 years of life to that by boosting your four types of resilience .
so , these are the different kinds and shapes of the hurdy-gurdy .
and this is a song that has a kind of a celtic feel .
this is something that clearly separates us from the animal kingdom .
they cross , but ronald reagan , a telegenic president , is in office .
you &apos;ll see that every time fantasy and imagination shows rise , it maps to a spike in unemployment .
there has not been a decade of television without a definitive , dominant tv mom .
the fund was deposited as a family reassure , in a safe , reliable security company in dakar , senegal , where i was only given temporary asylum .
but they said , &quot; no , but don &apos;t show anyone , &quot; but they slipped up .
and i have to say that it &apos;s not all me this year .
but you come back as a duck .
so , the scribbler is an attempt to create a generative tool .
i can love jogging .
nothing could be less materialistic , or more sentimental , than a teenager buying brand new jeans and tearing them at the knees , because he wants to please jennifer .
this uselessness is easily demonstrated , because in order to be valued i need another to desire me , which shows that i do not have any value of my own .
or this idea of the misunderstood genius , frustrated that the world doesn &apos;t fit in with his or her ideas .
so we thought like , this is too much of an opportunity , so we hired a feng shui master .
meanwhile , in copenhagen we &apos;re actually expanding the bicycle lanes .
it was kind of interesting because in the morning , from 9 to 11 , they were discussing the bailout package -- how many billions to invest in saving the danish economy .
so if you go back into the parking , into the corridors , it &apos;s almost like traveling into a parallel universe from cars and colors , into this sort of south-facing urban oasis .
so we actually sort of designed the entire island as a single ecosystem , exploiting wind energy to drive the desalination plants , and to use the thermal properties of water to heat and cool the buildings .
stayed when everybody else was dropping out .
the man on top can see , the blind man can walk .
&lt; translator &gt; &lt; / translator &gt;
and that is that those museums are usually passive , they have passive relationships between the museum as the presenter and the audience , as the receiver of information .
there is no space there .
it &apos;s basically one big volume of air that just oozes out in every direction .
there are also some restrictions about how much it could be lit .
and the very first program will be one of cultural dialogue and diplomacy organized in partnership with the council on foreign relations .
that is something that i did not get over .
so it turns out that propulsion isn &apos;t really the problem .
and now i love swimming . i can &apos;t wait to go swimming .
i couldn &apos;t read any of it -- hieroglyphics , it could have been -- because it was kanji , chinese characters adapted into the japanese language .
and now i love languages .
so i had a very short deadline for a competition .
i couldn &apos;t develop the attributes in my toes , the strength in my feet , to do that .
&lt; speaker &gt; bill gross &lt; / speaker &gt;
first , the coursework at caltech .
so i thought of an idea -- what if we collect the sun with a large reflector -- like i had been thinking about way back when , when i was in high school -- but maybe with modern technology we could make a cheaper , large collector , concentrate it to a small converter , and then the conversion device wouldn &apos;t have to be as expensive , because it &apos;s much smaller , rather than solar cells , which have to be covering the entire surface area that you want to gather sun from .
it collects about four and a half average hours of sunlight a day .
but after the stirling engine , otto came along , and also , he didn &apos;t invent the internal combustion engine , he just refined it .
that &apos;s basically the most fundamental heat engine you could possibly have .
if you put electricity in , this will get hot and this will get cold , you get refrigeration .
and what they do is step , very coarsely at first , and then very finely afterward .
it &apos;s just unbelievable what the potential is to take advantage of solar energy there , and i &apos;m really excited to talk more about finding ways we can help with that .
&lt; speaker &gt; marc pachter &lt; / speaker &gt;
that &apos;s the one advantage that older people have .
and she said , &quot; well , something very weird was happening .
there &apos;s nothing that ever happens that justifies people taking good hours of the day to be with them .
we were on the stage and then -- by the way , spectacular .
the usual sort of thing .
and here is this man who had given his whole life to uncovering jefferson and connecting with him , and he said , &quot; well ... &quot; -- i &apos;m going to do a bad southern accent .
she said , &quot; i keep this will by my bed , memento mori , and i change it all the time just because i want to . &quot;
after i graduated from the yale law school and got my first law job , my new haven analyst , dr. white , announced to me that he was going to close his practice in three months , several years before i had planned to leave new haven .
pat used to say that . have you killed you anyone ? &apos; rebel and val looked at me as if they or i had been splashed in the face with cold water .
they &apos;re different from me and you .
&quot; &apos; i give life and i take it away .
having made that decision they came to the united states , home of liberal arts education , to talk with some of us most closely identified with that kind of education .
and that was only the beginning .
the importance of coming to grips with values like justice , equity , truth , becomes increasingly evident as students discover that interest alone cannot tell them what they need to know when the issue is rethinking education , our approach to health , or strategies for achieving an economics of equity .
we intend to turn the intellectual and imaginative power , passion and boldness of our students , faculty and staff to developing strategies for acting on the critical challenges of our time .
the heads-up display is a smartphone that displays system parameters .
as i was approaching my late 40s , when i would wake up in the morning my first six thoughts would all be negative .
it wastes the body , but the mind remains intact .
and he wrote that , while he was in the camp , he could tell , should they ever be released , which of the people would be okay and which would not .
this is the qalandar community . they are a marginalized islamic community who live across india , and have been in india since the 13th century .
let &apos;s see if you can get something else . &quot; and we got the bear surrendered to -- we set up a sanctuary . we have four sanctuaries in india .
and the beautiful bears can of course live in the wild again .
i got drawn into the honeybee world completely by a fluke .
now we have the best data on honeybees , so i &apos;ll use them as an example .
you &apos;ve probably heard about it .
plant them in a pot on your doorstep .
thank you .
it &apos;s the &quot; what &quot; detector .
we make meaning by seeing , by an act of visual interrogation .
i went for a walk on the beach , watching the fishermen bundle their nets into mounds on the sand .
so i replaced the metal armature with a soft , fine mesh of a fiber 15 times stronger than steel .
but only in the last 120 years people started , or people knew more and more how to exploit , or how to use , this biological control phenomenon , or in fact , natural control phenomenon , to their own needs .
this is a predatory mite -- just as small as a spider mite , by the way , one millimeter , two millimeters long , not more than that , running quickly , hunting , chasing the spider mites .
only the egg of the parasite will be inserted into the body fluids of the aphid .
and look , this flower is flooded with predatory bugs , with the good ones after wiping out the bad ones , the thrips .
in this table , you can actually see what is an impact of a successful biological control by good bugs .
so actually , how can we do it ?
if you take a sea urchin larva from 8.1 , put it in a ph of 7.7 -- not a huge change -- it becomes deformed and dies .
they &apos;re not allowed to put more than 10 pounds of sand in a 50-gallon plastic bag .
and you add a little energy from the wind and the waves , and you get a big mess , a big mess that you can &apos;t possibly clean , you can &apos;t touch , you can &apos;t extract and , i think most importantly -- this is what i think -- you can &apos;t see it .
and he felt that -- he felt that it was coming to ask for help . sorry .
so for instance , most of the birds in this picture are migratory birds .
all they &apos;re doing is stirring it .
we could have the kinds of equipment that we would really need .
the first offshore wells were called whales .
it &apos;s an assumption that modernity is a product simply of competition , markets and technology .
i &apos;ll give you two quick ones .
now , this is completely different from the world &apos;s &#91; other &#93; most populous countries .
the result , by the way , is that the chinese have a very different view of the state .
it &apos;s kind of arrogant .
and the second implication is that the world will inevitably , as a consequence , become increasingly unfamiliar to us , because it &apos;ll be shaped by cultures and experiences and histories that we are not really familiar with , or conversant with .
for 200 years , the world was essentially governed by a fragment of the human population .
and our guide was a local science teacher .
but the reality is , these crazy cases are relatively rare . they don &apos;t usually win .
but reliable estimates range between 60 billion and 200 billion dollars per year .
there is no reason europe or china should have the fastest trains . &quot;
it actually changes the way people think .
the constitution is only 16 pages long .
law is a human institution ; responsibility is a human institution .
the reason why we forgot that is because the times in history when architecture did the most to transform society were those times when , actually , the one percent would build on behalf of the 99 percent , for various different reasons , whether that was through philanthropy in the 19th century , communism in the early 20th , the welfare state , and most recently , of course , through this inflated real estate bubble .
and a lot of people can &apos;t even afford them .
so about a year and a half ago , we started working on a project called wikihouse , and wikihouse is an open-source construction system .
contrary to almost everything that you might get taught at an architecture school , copying is good .
david keith : a critical look at geoengineering against climate change
all we lack is the action to actually spend the money to put those into place .
there &apos;s lots of mystery in the details , and there &apos;s some bad side effects , like it partially destroys the ozone layer -- and i &apos;ll get to that in a minute .
the one new thing is this essay .
gas molecules that bounce off the warm side bounce away with some extra velocity because it &apos;s warm .
but we &apos;re building that box .
let &apos;s say that we don &apos;t do geo-engineering , we do what we ought to do , which is get serious about cutting emissions .
i think there is a serious problem : as you talk about this , people begin to think they don &apos;t need to work so hard to cut emissions .
do you know of any painting that didn &apos;t have a painter ? yes / no .
over six million years , we and the chimps evolved our different ways .
now i &apos;m not going to have time to spell it all out , but i &apos;ll just say that only some kinds of debugging get the reward .
when people have this technology in their hands , you have a do-it-yourself biotech kit , grow your own -- grow your dog , grow your own cat .
so if life could be established out there , it would have all the essentials -- chemistry and sunlight -- everything that &apos;s needed .
there &apos;s a long history in astronomy of unlikely things turning out to be there . and i mean , the finest example of that was radio astronomy as a whole .
so as you go further away from the sun , this becomes more and more powerful .
but in the long run , if there &apos;s no life there , we create it ourselves .
and she &apos;s right . every time you go there , you know that if you actually need critical care -- critical care of any sort -- if you have an accident -- of which there are many , there are accidents everywhere -- where do they go ?
so , these are the problems .
but we had problems with it . we had severe problems there .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;ve all seen or heard this before : &quot; we , the willing , have been doing so much with so little for so long -- -- we are now qualified to do anything with nothing . &quot;
it was in this gentleman &apos;s house in the potomac , for those of you who are familiar with maryland .
it &apos;s an apartheid , and it discriminates against the &#91; nonprofit &#93; sector in five different areas , the first being compensation .
people are yearning to measure the full distance of their potential on behalf of the causes that they care about deeply .
all of the scale goes to coca-cola and burger king .
within just five years , we had multiplied that 554 times into 194 million dollars after all expenses for breast cancer research .
so the next time you &apos;re looking at a charity , don &apos;t ask about the rate of their overhead .
now , i didn &apos;t start this fire , but i did pour petrol on it .
so i quickly went to work with a great team around me .
in fact , one thing &apos;s for sure , in my experience , we love to laugh like hell .
in south africa , ndebele women use these symbols and other geometric patterns to paint their homes in bright colors , and the zulu women use the symbols in the beads that they weave into bracelets and necklaces .
i &apos;m going to talk to you today about my work on suspended animation .
seven hours later , still without a heartbeat , they brought her back to life , and she went on to be the head radiologist in the hospital that treated her .
and so i was wondering , when we were trying to reproduce the work with the skier , that we noticed that , of course , she had no oxygen consumption , and so maybe she was in a similar state of suspended animation .
it &apos;s filled with this toxic gas , hydrogen sulfide .
it &apos;s rapidly metabolized , and all you have to do after six hours of being in this state of de-animation is simply put the thing out in room air , and it warms up , and it &apos;s none the worse for wear .
now , and so -- thank you . the phase 1 safety studies are over , and we &apos;re doing fine , we &apos;re now moved on .
it was a website called nerve.com , the tagline of which was &quot; literate smut . &quot;
rg : i &apos;m sorry .
and i think i &apos;m speaking obviously here to the father &apos;s experience .
and she said -- i &apos;ll never forget -- &quot; it &apos;s just not something you want to say to a mother that &apos;s having a baby for the first time . &quot;
in a survey , 74 percent of women said that miscarriage , they felt , was partly their fault , which is awful .
rg : and so in effect , we trade average happiness .
i love photography , i love rockets , and i &apos;m going to talk to you about a hobby that can scale and show you some photos that i &apos;ve taken over the years with kids like these ; kids that hopefully will grow up to love rocketry and eventually become maybe another richard branson or diamandis .
voices : it &apos;s going ballistic . oh shit .
and the more technical topics , such as architecture , materials and , strangely enough , men , those are not good topics to talk about .
and the tedpad is a matrix of 100 specifically selected , highly curated sentences that you can easily piece together to get your own tedtalk .
and somehow i said , &quot; you know , you guys are hypocrites .
the experiment is this : is it possible to have institutions in our country , universities , where people from all backgrounds can come and learn and learn to work together and learn to become leaders and to support each other in that experience ?
it &apos;s an american challenge . half of you in the room .
but she had a factor that was very important .
i &apos;ll never forget a faculty member calling the staff and saying , &quot; i &apos;ve got this young man in class , a young black guy , and he seems like he &apos;s just not excited about the work .
thank you all very much .
but after some nagging , i got him to do that .
so my next thing : i was off to scotland to get mica .
but this is it .
the reason is because in the first month of a baby &apos;s life , its only job is to grow .
this seems counterintuitive , but turns out that as infant mortality is reduced , population sizes also decrease , because parents don &apos;t need to anticipate that their babies are going to die .
you can go online and buy a hacking service to knock your business competitor offline .
awww .
that website address at the top there , the browser crashes as it hits one of these exploit packs , and up pops fake antivirus .
and our cybercriminals had done the same thing .
i was relatively inhibited compared to the cybercriminals , who wouldn &apos;t be so concerned by law , and here you can see my mobile device .
most laws are national in their implementation , despite cybercrime conventions , where the internet is borderless and international by definition .
i &apos;d like to talk to you today a little bit about the work that my brother hays and i are doing -- that &apos;s us there . that &apos;s both of us actually — specifically about a concept that we &apos;ve been developing over the last few years , this idea of location-aware music .
but what we &apos;re doing , integrating gps with music , is really just one idea .
but how could he convince the public that the millions of volts required to make it work were safe ?
mt : tesla thought he had the answer .
and my brother and i were raised with all that you really need : love , strong values and a belief that with a good education and a whole lot of hard work , that there was nothing that we could not do .
we know what fairness and justice and opportunity look like .
i liked being on time . i liked getting my work done .
&lt; speaker &gt; chrystia freeland &lt; / speaker &gt;
talking about income inequality , even if you &apos;re not on the forbes 400 list , can make us feel uncomfortable .
i love the internet . i love my mobile devices .
that &apos;s shown in what i consider to be the most scary economic statistic of our time .
now like with anything that &apos;s really different from the status quo , it didn &apos;t always go so well testing that aircraft .
and that &apos;s the automated wing-folding mechanism .
on average , there &apos;s one within 20 to 30 miles of wherever you are in the united states .
&apos;the world &apos; is objective , logical , universal , factual , scientific .
alexander asked , &quot; what are you doing ? &quot;
but when he reached the mountain peak , he found the peak covered with countless flags of world-conquerors before him , each one claiming &quot; &apos; i was here first &apos; ...
which is right ?
it is not about documentation and contract .
but nobody was interested in listening to it , you see , until i met kishore biyani of the future group .
and it &apos;s a very dangerous question , because it leads you to the path of fundamentalism and violence .
now , the ideology of choice is very successful in opening for us a space to think about some imagined future .
then she said , &quot; for weeks i was researching which hotel to stay for this one night .
now , psychoanalysts know very well that people surprisingly don &apos;t have passion for knowledge but passion for ignorance .
we are anxious that we are not good enough .
in fact , if you fly over germany , for example , and you look down and you see these hundreds of little villages , they &apos;re all about a mile apart .
and that &apos;s a very important trend to think about .
you can begin to develop a whole typology of streetscapes and the vehicles that can go on them . i won &apos;t go through all of them . i &apos;ll just show one .
you can dial in 40 calories going into work and 500 going home , when you can take a shower .
we don &apos;t really believe in cameras to do things in homes .
a couple months ago , payne started a food blog called neverseconds , and she would take her camera with her every day to school to document her school lunches .
sorry for the spoiler alert , but no world peace . not yet .
better arguing ? that &apos;s the question .
his point of view on this was very clear .
it &apos;s an open-source programming language , and all of the interconnections between the people -- this is now not a software graph , but a people graph , all of the interconnections among the people working on that project — and this doesn &apos;t look like an org chart .
the stuff in green is the stuff that got added .
the question for us now is , are we going to let the programmers keep it to themselves ?
these are the blue bars .
bed nets are very cheap .
so i start with immunization .
now , a kilo of lentils is tiny .
we can know the answer to this question .
so what &apos;s the best ?
we need that kind of information , we need more of it , and then we need to guide policy .
deworming .
now here at ted , we &apos;re solving some of the great riddles of science and mysteries of the universe .
so let &apos;s get a sense of what is happening in this part of the world .
these are the filters and funnels of global capital .
these are pipeline routes , which emerge from kurdistan , which is an oil-rich region .
these countries &apos; borders originate from stalin &apos;s decrees .
the e.u. also became a currency block , and is now the most powerful trade block in the entire world .
pakistan and afghanistan are still so fragile that neither of them have dealt constructively with the problem of pashtun nationalism .
i call them &quot; the mystic &quot; and &quot; the warrior . &quot;
now we all love to trot out these three mystic warriors as if they were born with the saint gene .
and then , before you get together , agree on some ground rules .
i &apos;ll meet you there . &quot;
i said , &quot; it &apos;s a prize from &#91; an &#93; art competition . &quot;
so this is capturing the trace of a thumbprint because , knowingly or unknowingly , whatever we do , you know , we leave our traces here .
he would definitely say , &quot; god came down from heaven , and he said unto the cow , &apos; thou shalt cross the road . &apos; and cow crossed the road , and there was much rejoicing as a holy cow . &quot;
you know the wall is almost like -- this is the first skin , and this is the second , and there &apos;s a third , and each creates a meaning .
you buy this for 3,000 rupees , it &apos;ll become 30,000 in two months .
that evaporating sculpture gave me a greater faith that maybe there is many more possibilities to capture &#91; the &#93; invisible .
you can see the detail .
i would love my children to be able to meet my family in the congo .
but don &apos;t throw away your phones yet , because the incredible irony is that the technology that has placed such unsustainable , devastating demands on the congo is the same technology that has brought this situation to our attention .
i missed my family and the friends i left behind .
and by &quot; regretted it , &quot; i mean that i stepped outside of the tattoo place -- this is just a couple miles from here down on the lower east side -- and i had a massive emotional meltdown in broad daylight on the corner of east broadway and canal street .
so in other words , regret requires two things .
they account for less than three percent of our total regrets .
now the effect of perseveration is to basically take these first three components of regret and put them on an infinite loop .
or you can have your last day at work .
when other people see my tattoo , for the most part they like how it looks .
&lt; speaker &gt; jeff han &lt; / speaker &gt;
if i grab the canvas , i can kind of do the same thing -- stretch it out .
we &apos;re not really accessing it . and one of the reasons why i think that is , is because -- we &apos;ll be helped by things like graphics and visualization and inference tools , but i also think a big part of it is going to be starting to be able to have better interfaces , to be able to drill down into this kind of data , while still thinking about the big picture here .
this kind of technology is going to let even more people get into it , and i &apos;m really looking forward to interacting with all you guys over the next few days and seeing how it can apply to your respective fields .
i mean , there &apos;s prison costs , there &apos;s police costs , there &apos;s court costs , all these things that you &apos;re spending money on to deal with these guys . what &apos;s it worth ?
investors get two opportunities : for the first time , they can invest in social change .
so taking peterborough as an example , we add case management across all of the different organizations that we &apos;re working with so they know what actually has been done with different prisoners , and at the same time they learn from the ministry of justice , and we learn , because we pushed for the data , what actually happens , whether they get re-arrested or not .
the u.s. accounted for 79 percent of total news coverage .
imagine if you could surf facebook ... from the middle ages . well , it may not be as far off as it sounds . in a fun and interesting talk , researcher and engineer frederic kaplan shows off the venice time machine , a project to digitize 80 kilometers of books to create a historical and geographical simulation of venice across 1000 years . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
there &apos;s a lot of material available -- newspaper , printed books , thousands of printed books .
of course , when you digitize , that &apos;s not enough , because these documents , most of them are in latin , in tuscan , in venetian dialect , so you need to transcribe them , to translate them in some cases , to index them , and this is obviously not easy .
you can go one step beyond and actually create a simulation system , create a mediterranean simulator which is capable actually of reconstructing even the information we are missing , which would enable us to have questions you could ask like if you were using a route planner .
so what we must do for this paradigm shift is actually foster a new generation of &quot; digital humanists &quot; that are going to be ready for this shift .
licklider foresaw computers doing all the routinizable work that was required to prepare the way for insights and decision making .
computers don &apos;t detect novel patterns and new behaviors , but humans do . humans , using technology , testing hypotheses , searching for insight by asking machines to do things for them .
&lt; speaker &gt; ian goldin &lt; / speaker &gt;
our mobile phones are more powerful than some of the strongest computers of 20 years ago .
and so a new awareness will have to arise , of how we deal with these , how we mobilize ourselves , in a new way , and come together as a community to manage systemic risk .
and what i want to do today , for the first time , is show you a little bit of what we saw .
poor player : how much is that ?
we &apos;ve had people play games to see who &apos;s more or less likely to cheat to increase their chances of winning a prize .
and that &apos;s understandable because the american dream is an idea in which we all have an equal opportunity to succeed and prosper , as long as we apply ourselves and work hard , and a piece of that means that sometimes , you need to put your own interests above the interests and well-being of other people around you .
and there &apos;s the emergence of dozens of grassroots movements , like we are the one percent , the resource generation , or wealth for common good , in which the most privileged members of the population , members of the one percent and elsewhere , people who are wealthy , are using their own economic resources , adults and youth alike , that &apos;s what &apos;s most striking to me , leveraging their own privilege , their own economic resources , to combat inequality by advocating for social policies , changes in social values , and changes in people &apos;s behavior , that work against their own economic interests but that may ultimately restore the american dream .
so here steve pinker and i were considering the magnitude of wars during the last two centuries .
&lt; speaker &gt; olafur eliasson &lt; / speaker &gt;
with such a big space , the problem is obviously that there is a discrepancy between what your body can embrace , and what the space , in that sense , is .
the water has an ability to make the city negotiable , tangible .
the small mountains in the foreground , they move more .
how do we create an idea which is both tolerant to individuality , and also to collectivity , without polarizing the two into two different opposites ?
now , you could ask this question , why were the doctors doing this ?
so you &apos;re going to be in charge , you &apos;re going to be in control , you &apos;re going to be in the driver &apos;s seat .
less effort , you &apos;re less persistent , and so on .
and this can happen in the medical domain , if you think about it .
and why do i say that ?
this is what their setup looks like for the first model , where you get to have access to the car .
they wrote software to stabilize -- even though they were on a bus and maybe someone &apos;s holding their phone at an angle -- to stabilize the phone , process it , and you may know on your smartphone , when you type a password , the keys pop out a little bit , and they were able to use that to reconstruct what the person was typing , and had a language model for detecting typing .
every security expert wants to hack a smartphone , and we tend to look at the usb port , the gps for tracking , the camera , the microphone , but no one up till this point had looked at the accelerometer .

you will put the wind in winsome , lose some .
and i know that i have been waiting all week to tell this joke .
the bowery poetry club became my classroom and my home , and the poets who performed encouraged me to share my stories as well .
and here &apos;s what happens , and here &apos;s what you would discover too if we all started sharing our lists out loud .
i use spoken word to help my students rediscover wonder , to fight their instincts to be cool and unfazed and , instead , actively pursue being engaged with what goes on around them , so that they can reinterpret and create something from it .
i think december 54th was probably supposed to be 24th .
i start quickly becoming part of your past .
but i took a liking to them because they dwell on the fringes of society .
when you go into spaces like this , you &apos;re directly accessing the past , because they sit untouched for decades .
the tunnels are famous for having been used during the development of the manhattan project .
this is a german bunker .
i like doing more than just exploring these spaces .
we called the project cyark , which stands for cyber archive .
and we created a project we call the cyark 500 challenge -- and that is to digitally preserve 500 world heritage sites in five years .

environmental challenges fall into the same three categories , and most of what we think about are local environmental problems : air pollution , water pollution , hazardous waste dumps . but there are also regional environmental problems , like acid rain from the midwest to the northeast , and from western europe to the arctic , and from the midwest out the mississippi into the dead zone of the gulf of mexico .
here &apos;s the stratosphere : cooler .
but responses can actually make a huge difference in the poor countries . this is a proposal that has been talked about a lot in europe .
we can do this . don &apos;t tell me that we don &apos;t have the capacity to do it .
now , nobody is talking on that scale . but i do believe that between now and november , it is possible .
maybe you &apos;re hunching , crossing your legs , maybe wrapping your ankles .
this expression , which is known as pride , jessica tracy has studied . she shows that people who are born with sight and people who are congenitally blind do this when they win at a physical competition .
so my main collaborator dana carney , who &apos;s at berkeley , and i really wanted to know , can you fake it till you make it ?
&quot; for two minutes , &quot; you say , &quot; i want you to stand like this , and it &apos;s going to make you feel more powerful . &quot;
we decided that the one that most people could relate to because most people had been through was the job interview .
they bring their ideas , but as themselves , with no , you know , residue over them .
you &apos;re going to stay , and this is what you &apos;re going to do .
leave that situation feeling like , oh , i really feel like i got to say who i am and show who i am .
but one of the principles is that everybody who is part of the community gets to fight and argue as hard as they can for what they believe .
and merging them together to make the final quantum theory of space and time and gravity , is the culmination of that , something that &apos;s going on right now .
and what we &apos;ve been working out is the implications , really , of the idea that the universe is made up of relations .
and that &apos;s too short of a time period for all the different risk factors that we know to change .
and here &apos;s what the story is .
that &apos;s a man heart attack .
and we &apos;re about two and a half years into a five-year study .
we &apos;re bending the curve .
the one after that , i stood on top of a hundred foot pillar for 36 hours .
and i stayed inside of that water tank hoping my core temperature would start to drop .
and then there is static apnea .
i started learning about the world-record holder .
so , i had to add handcuffs , while holding my breath , to escape from .
it was my ex-girlfriend . while i was breaking the record underwater for the first time , she was sifting through my blackberry , checking all my messages .
then , what they also did was , which we never did before , is there was a heart-rate monitor .
then at 13 minutes , maybe because of the hypochondria .
so , i get to new york city the next day , and this kid walks up to me -- i &apos;m walking out of the apple store -- this kid walks up to me he &apos;s like , &quot; yo , d ! &quot;
this is a quiz . what do you think ?
this is in 1960 .
it &apos;s not one of these statistics which is very doubtful .
it &apos;s an amazing improvement , from seven children per woman , they &apos;ve gone all the way down to between four and five .
there are countries up here which are very poor .
the rest of you , you will grow older and you will get two billion children .
one of the key questions in all of science , &quot; is there life outside of earth ? &quot;
we &apos;re looking at valles marineris , the largest canyon in the solar system , superimposed on a map of the united states , 3,000 miles across .
this is a measurement we obtained a few years ago from a mars-orbiting satellite called odyssey .
that &apos;s because the northern hemisphere is the region of the ancient ocean basin .
this is what ares looks like as it flies over mars .
the rocket engine begins .
in this image-filled talk , yann arthus-bertrand displays his three most recent projects on humanity and our habitat -- stunning aerial photographs in his series &quot; the earth from above , &quot; personal interviews from around the globe featured in his web project &quot; 6 billion others , &quot; and his soon-to-be-released movie , &quot; home , &quot; which documents human impact on the environment through breathtaking video .
there is a new face of kilimanjaro without ice .
landscape was not enough .
after many people said i couldn &apos;t do that .
we depend on water , forests , deserts , oceans .
we have to believe what we know .
then he practices for another and takes lessons -- now he &apos;s 10 .

you couldn &apos;t tell the difference between somebody from texas and somebody from rome .
and for the rest of your life , every time you hear classical music , you &apos;ll always be able to know if you hear those impulses .
and then finally ...
now that is something .
and you know how you find out ? you look at their eyes .

most of the population growth of the next 50 years will be in cities .
that &apos;s where maureen went to school .
this is a computer installed in the entrance to their slum by a revolutionary social entrepreneur called sugata mitra who has conducted the most radical experiments , showing that children , in the right conditions , can learn on their own with the help of computers .
our education systems all work on the principle that there is a payoff , but you have to wait quite a long time .
so i met this character , steven .
they know what to expect , even though it &apos;ll be subtly different and the colors will be different and the name will be different .
but because so many of the issues in education aren &apos;t just in school , they &apos;re in family and community , what you also need , definitely , is more on the right hand side .
and literally , this guy sat in my office in new hampshire and said , &quot; i want you to give me something that we can put on these kids that &apos;ll pick up a raisin or a grape off a table , they &apos;ll be able to put it in their mouth without destroying either one , and they &apos;ll be able to know the difference without looking at it . &quot;
these kids have attitudes that you just can &apos;t believe .
they smell with their antennae , and they interact with their antennae , so when one ant touches another with its antennae , it can tell , for example , if the other ant is a nestmate and what task that other ant has been doing .
and what we &apos;re looking for is whether there might be small differences among colonies in how many interactions each ant needs before it &apos;s willing to go out and forage , because a colony like that would forage less .
but the ants are so abundant and diverse in the tropics that there &apos;s a lot of competition .
and i think it &apos;s pretty likely that the invasive species , the ones that come into our buildings , are going to be really good at this , because they &apos;re in your kitchen because they &apos;re really good at finding food and water .
dad helped design the control panels for the ibm 360 computer .
it mostly projects tragedy and fear and misfortune , and it projects that message , that story , so strongly that it almost blots out anything else .
what &apos;s the difference here , the wheelchair with no lights and the wheelchair with lights ?
you can probably tell there are two sets of twins , the result of ivf technology , in vitro fertilization technology , due to some physical limitations i won &apos;t go into .
we &apos;re really hoping he thanks us for that later on .
and we can &apos;t just imitate the past . no .
an object imbued with intent -- it has power , it &apos;s treasure , we &apos;re drawn to it .
saparmurat niyazov , he was one of them .
and in the years that i &apos;ve been , and we &apos;ve all been campaigning and investigating , i &apos;ve repeatedly seen that what makes corruption on a global , massive scale possible , well it isn &apos;t just greed or the misuse of power or that nebulous phrase &quot; weak governance . &quot;
in virtually every case of corruption that we &apos;ve investigated , shell companies have appeared , and sometimes it &apos;s been impossible to find out who is really involved in the deal .
but as a campaigner and investigator , i have a different view , because i &apos;ve seen what can happen when an idea gains momentum .
this is blue gene , the fastest computer in the world .
that process is called a synapse .
and these are individual potassium ions that are flowing through that pore .
and the way they represent information is they break up that data into little pieces that are represented by pulses and different neurons .
let me explain what you &apos;re going to see , ok , because it &apos;s putting out different kinds of information , it &apos;s not as straightforward as a camera .
thank you .
a polar bear swimming in the arctic , by paul nicklen .
but this flashbulb memory , as it &apos;s called , is when all the elements came together to define not just the event , but my emotional connection to it .
a lion having a late night snack -- notice he &apos;s got a broken tooth .
and most of that growth is not in the cities , but in the slums that surround them .
from here , the more severely wounded are transported back to germany , where they meet up with their families for the first time .
to her , here was this big , goofy creature in the water that for some reason didn &apos;t seem to be interested in chasing penguins .
this is a face-scanning sphere , with 156 white leds all around that allow us to photograph her in a series of very controlled illumination conditions .
and by looking at how the different color channels of the illumination , the red and the green and the blue , diffuse the light differently , we can come up with a way of shading the skin on the computer .
and let &apos;s take a look at a computer-generated version of bruce , running in a new environment .
i think we should perhaps do a bit more of it .
they can be 200 miles an hour , 300 miles an hour .

&lt; speaker &gt; ken jennings &lt; / speaker &gt;
there was armed forces tv , and if you didn &apos;t speak korean , that &apos;s what you were watching .
the third reason i said yes is because i was pretty confident that i was going to win .
we were not playing in l.a. on the regular &quot; jeopardy &quot; set .
if you watch the news , you &apos;ll see occasionally -- and i see this all the time -- that pharmacists now , there &apos;s a machine that can fill prescriptions automatically without actually needing a human pharmacist .
the things we know are still important .
she was a 10-year-old girl from surrey , england on vacation with her parents a few years ago in phuket , thailand .
i have always believed that the things we know -- that knowledge is an absolute good , that the things we have learned and carry with us in our heads are what make us who we are , as individuals and as a species .
we can live in one of these two worlds .
the sources of human problems have to do with egotism , &quot; i. &quot;
that is a moment which is a gift of god to us -- a gift when , for a moment , he lifts that boundary which makes us insist on &quot; i , i , i , me , me , me , &quot; and instead , like the person in rumi &apos;s story , we say , &quot; oh , this is all you .
this is also expressed in biblical vocabulary when we are taught that we were created in the divine image .
she sleeps with her cellphone , so do i .
but then he stops himself and he says , &quot; you know , i &apos;m not telling you the truth .
over and over i hear , &quot; i would rather text than talk . &quot;
and i ask myself , &quot; why have things come to this ? &quot;
but in the process , we set ourselves up to be isolated .
at work , we &apos;re so busy communicating that we often don &apos;t have time to think , we don &apos;t have time to talk , about the things that really matter .
what do i mean by that ?
the point of it was to listen to him speaking like writing .
&quot; i love the font you &apos;re using , btw . &quot;
you don &apos;t just zip right into it .
often they would have no idea what half of it meant because a whole new language has developed among our young people doing something as mundane as what it looks like to us when they &apos;re batting around on their little devices .
to combine engineering and design and ...
and so i want to tell you about the interaction between computer-based adaptive technology and the many volunteers who helped me over the years to become the person i am today .
and you see it has no , what do you call it , no screen .
but in 1989 , he teamed up with bill joyce to develop a program that would read out what was on the computer screen from the net or from what was on the computer .
there are other barriers brought about by our laws .
okay . okay . okay . okay . okay .
and the reason for this shape is that at the very beginning , let &apos;s say one or two people are infected , or affected by the thing and then they affect , or infect , two people , who in turn affect four , eight , 16 and so forth , and you get the epidemic growth phase of the curve .
b is located on the edge of the network .
and you can get an intuitive appreciation for this if you imagine just the people at the perimeter of the network .
so , this is a map of 714 students and their friendship ties .
and the answer is no .
one is fully passive , like i just described -- as in , for instance , the trucker example , where we don &apos;t actually intervene in the population in any way .
so right now , you &apos;re doing just fine .
it &apos;s a neurological test , just in case you were wondering .
now we can remember those four things for about 10 to 20 seconds unless we do something with it , unless we process it , unless we apply it to something , unless we talk to somebody about it .
practice for some reason became a very negative thing .
the first guy -- we &apos;ll call him adam -- is transfixed by the beauty of the perfect human form .
ok , about a -- two dozen .
ok , so what &apos;s on the first draft of the moral mind ?
the fifth foundation is purity / sanctity .
in-group , authority , purity -- this stuff has nothing to do with morality . i reject it . &quot;
but the &apos; 60s inevitably gives way to the &apos; 70s , where the cuttings of the apertures hurt a little bit more .
i think that &apos;s probably right , although this is a controversial issue .
it &apos;s really precious , and it &apos;s really easy to lose .
so what should you do ? am i telling you to not strive ?
and yet , one is a chimp , and the other is a cow .
so this to me became the important question to answer : how many neurons does the human brain have , and how does that compare to other animals ?
and there , if you do the math , you find that a generic primate with 86 billion neurons would have a brain of about 1.2 kilos , which seems just right , in a body of some 66 kilos , which in my case is exactly right , which brings us to a very unsurprising but still incredibly important conclusion : i am a primate .
what about us ?
i want to share with you some ideas about the secret power of time , in a very short time .
and you do it automatically and non-consciously .
they sacrifice hobbies . and they sacrifice sleep . so it affects their health .
but then the anger and the depression about my father &apos;s death set in .
and i went . i hadn &apos;t bathed in three days .
i was winning awards . i was living in my own apartment .
and i still worked as a tour leader , traveled back and forth in china , tibet and central asia .
and very often i &apos;ve been an outsider .
so it &apos;s actually a papercut that &apos;s nine yards long .
in fact , in the picture , you have two of them .
then i have the fruit from europe for the ranchers .
and i wanted to give them an escape .
but here you can see around the world how people are using google .
but you can see also , once again -- so some places are much more wired than others , and you can see all the bandwidth across the u.s. , going up over to asia , europe in the other direction , and so forth .
in fact , many of the organizations that are here -- the acumen fund , i think approtec we have running , i &apos;m not sure if that one &apos;s up yet -- and many of the people who have presented here are running through google grants .
and -- well , i &apos;ll leave you in suspense .
for example , the &quot; buy iceland &quot; was from a media article .
we also allow dogs and things like that , and we &apos;ve had , i think , a really fun culture at our company , which helps people work and enjoy what they &apos;re doing .
because you can type , you know , any kind of thing into google , and you expect an answer back , right ?
and i think we &apos;re really lucky to have that kind of business model because everyone in the world has access to our search , and i think that &apos;s a tremendous , tremendous benefit .
well , i said to her , &quot; you know , kids don &apos;t learn from people they don &apos;t like . &quot;
you just have to strut . &quot;
you made me feel like i was somebody , when i knew , at the bottom , i wasn &apos;t .
and that happened a lot : &quot; you pommies , you can &apos;t play cricket , rugby . &quot;
there seems to be a lot of data suggesting that vitamin d is very good for you .
we worked out a mechanism , which -- no was helping cells survive .
i &apos;m not sure exactly how much .
so what you can do is you can multiply those data by the no that &apos;s released and you can calculate how much nitric oxide would be released from the skin into the circulation .
in 2007 , i became the attorney general of the state of new jersey .
when i was an assistant d.a. , and when i was a federal prosecutor , i looked at the cases in front of me , and i generally made decisions based on my instinct and my experience .
they &apos;re just waiting for their day in court .
they were unbelievably expensive to administer , they were time-consuming , they were limited to the local jurisdiction in which they &apos;d been created .
we &apos;re now working on risk tools for prosecutors and for police officers as well , to try to take a system that runs today in america the same way it did 50 years ago , based on instinct and experience , and make it into one that runs on data and analytics .
here we have the description of the order of nature .
let &apos;s see .
they communicate with plants of other species and they communicate with animals by producing chemical volatiles , for example , during the pollination .
we have almost 14 million roots .
and these are three possibilities that we are working on to build hybrids , driven by algae or by the leaves at the end , by the most , most powerful parts of the plants , by the roots .
this is a joint effort between me and french artist jr .

let &apos;s take a contemporary example of the dispute about justice .
it would be an unfair advantage if he gets to ride in a golf cart .
charlie , what do you say to warren ?
he said it &apos;s not possible to determine the essential nature of a game like golf .
the opponents of same-sex marriage say that the purpose of marriage , fundamentally , is procreation , and that &apos;s what &apos;s worthy of honoring and recognizing and encouraging .
and so my real dream would be to take the public television series that we &apos;ve created of the course -- it &apos;s available now , online , free for everyone anywhere in the world -- and to see whether we can partner with institutions , at universities in china , in india , in africa , around the world , to try to promote civic education and also a richer kind of democratic debate .
when you put all the mental illnesses together , they account for roughly 15 percent of the total global burden of disease .
well today , i &apos;m very pleased to report to you that there have been many experiments in task shifting in mental health care across the developing world over the past decade , and i want to share with you the findings of three particular such experiments , all three of which focused on depression , the most common of all mental illnesses .
and my childhood is more hick than i could ever possibly relate to you , and also more intellectual than you would ever expect .
and then my other second set of rules -- i hate to say &quot; rules &quot; because it &apos;s art -- my criteria would be the three h &apos;s , which is head , heart and hands .
this piece , which is called &quot; flipped earth &quot; -- she was interested in taking the sky and using it to cleanse barren ground .
and in this one it &apos;s called &quot; drawing the short stick . &quot;
and so she came up with creating these pocket-sized artworks that are portraits of the person that would carry them .
we just have that natural way of seeing .
the next is a collective of artists called the silver dobermans , and their motto is to spread pragmatism one person at a time .
and i have to say , vera kind of scares me .
i looked into the face of her son sitting next to her , and his face was just riven with grief and confusion .
and when i worked in the prison system , it was so clear to me , this : that many of us in this room , and almost all of the men that i worked with on death row , the seeds of their own compassion had never been watered .
it &apos;s a female archetype : she who perceives the cries of suffering in the world .
i &apos;m going to , if i can have my first slide up here , and you &apos;ll see the title of my talk and my two affiliations .
we are in the pre-paradigm days , if you want to use thomas kuhn .
why do we study ants ? well , it &apos;s interesting .
well , i just told you there &apos;s so much data coming out your ears .
and so , if some people have fallen into the pit of metaphysical dualism , some really smart people , too , but we can reject all that .
and the same thing about tectonic plates , you know ?
and the alligator has some very sophisticated senses .
this is the most important slide of my talk , so i &apos;ll dwell on it a little bit .
as i put my hand on this table , i expect to feel it stop .
so i found the best people to work with are physicists , engineers and mathematicians , who tend to think algorithmically .
and we &apos;re going to attach these memories to sensors , and the sensors will experience real-live , real-world data , and these things are going to learn about their environment .
now he confused me from the very start , because light doesn &apos;t cool things down .
dance really can make science easier to understand .
i shall now , therefore , humbly propose my own thoughts , which i hope will not be liable to the least objection .
this little robot was somehow able to tap into something deeply social within us -- and with that , the promise of an entirely new way we could interact with robots .
to answer questions like , how is it that , from a brief encounter , we &apos;re able to make an estimate of how trustworthy another person is ?
we try skype , we try phone calls , but my boys are little -- they don &apos;t really want to talk ; they want to play .
is it really just the quality of advice and information that matters ?
and when it &apos;s in their world , they can relate to it and play with it in a way that &apos;s fundamentally different from how they play with it on the screen .
this is what we want out of our senses .
her mother &apos;s doing everything she can .
girl : no , the other one was a book .
when you say a word , what you care is that word was perceived correctly .
if we could play these two sound clips in succession .
and it turns out that his temporal bones were harvested when he died to try to look at the cause of his deafness , which is why he has molding clay and his skull is bulging out on the side there .
since then , i &apos;ve never looked back .
and this is my son .
the scale of the challenge for architects is to find a solution to house these people .
two-by-four construction is sort of like the little eight-dot bricks of lego that we all played with as kids , and you can make all kinds of cool things out of lego at that size , and out of two-by-fours .
that &apos;s how much it takes .
beardyman : the polyphonic me
so the polyphony problem : i &apos;ve only got one voice .
like this .
and in fact , the smallest unit of matter that can evolve independently is , in fact , a single cell -- a bacteria .
we &apos;re awfully careful in the lab to try and avoid various biohazards .
and we went through a variety of worlds .
this is how i remember what i need as a chemist .
if we can somehow encourage these molecules to talk to each other and make the right shapes and compete , they will start to form cells that will replicate and compete .
and again , when you &apos;re thinking about how improbable this is , remember , five billion years ago , we were not here , and there was no life .
why do we crave love so much , even to the point that we would die for it ? to learn more about our very real , very physical need for romantic love , helen fisher and her research team took mris of people in love -- and people who had just been dumped .
so , before i start telling you about the brain , i want to read for you what i think is the most powerful love poem on earth .
we found activity in some cells called the a10 cells , cells that actually make dopamine , a natural stimulant , and spray it to many brain regions .
how , you know , what have i lost ?
and she was driving along in her car the other day , and suddenly she heard a song on the car radio that reminded her of this man .
i know what happens in the brain , when you do become in love , but i don &apos;t know why you fall in love with one person rather than another .
men tend to get intimacy from side-by-side doing .
as wages increase that also lifts the burden on the poor and the working class .
they go bad very quickly if you don &apos;t , and if you don &apos;t have stable power grid , this doesn &apos;t happen , so kids die .
you can spray ; the problem is there are environmental issues .
it creates a very high peak power and it lets you do all kinds of interesting things ; in particular , it lets you find hemozoin .
we &apos;re going to the dry season now .
clinics are full of people that have malaria .
now , that &apos;s a fairly straightforward image processing routine , and let me show you how it works .
einstein said that &quot; i never think about the future — it comes soon enough . &quot;
so how can the industrial internet help here ?
but let me stress two things here .
this new technological revolution is upon us .
and this graph sort of sums up what the problem is .
this brings up a really important point , which is that we tend in this country to talk about democrats and republicans and think there &apos;s this little group over there called independents that &apos;s , what , two percent ?
and that part of it has not changed .
i &apos;ve been in afghanistan for 21 years .
and the orthopedic center was closed .
maybe the machinery is broken .
but they insisted .
very sad , dark .
so i asked him , &quot; what is that ? &quot;
we need to employ someone to glue and to screw the sole of the feet .
so of course , i understood .
there are plenty of countries at war like afghanistan .
i &apos;m here to talk to you about the economic invisibility of nature .
it &apos;s not just about the amazonas , or indeed about rainforests .
the green represents the percentage .
in other words , what are the costs of doing business as usual ?
the way to do this is to do it on a company basis , to take leadership forward , and to do it for as many important sectors which have a cost , and to disclose these answers .
what we &apos;re also missing is blue carbon , which , by the way , is the largest store of carbon -- more than 55 percent .
&lt; speaker &gt; his holiness the karmapa &lt; / speaker &gt;
when i was 14 , i escaped from tibet and became even further removed from my mother and father , my relatives , my friends and my homeland .
so i think that , in this way , it &apos;s always possible for us to derive something positive that can help us understand one another better .
unfortunately , when i was there i couldn &apos;t find one of them , but you have the antlers as proof .
so instead of thinking of that as a truck , think of that as a 3,000-square-foot home .
that &apos;s creating the largest toxic impoundments in the history of the planet .
and we &apos;re doing this on the second largest oil reserves on the planet .
we need to ensure that these wetlands and forests that are our best and greatest and most critical defense against global warming are protected , and we are not releasing that carbon bomb into the atmosphere .
but it was his production of a butterfly that was the most beautiful .
they believe they can win .
and she pointed to the work on the left to tell me how problematic this image was , as it related , for her , to the idea of how black people had been represented .
this new set of questions is : what does it mean , right now , to be african-american in america ?
i &apos;m here to tell you a few tales of passion .
it is all about passion .
well , she didn &apos;t say that exactly .
mapendo , in swahili , means great love .
she risks a lot and she &apos;s terrified .
men run the world , and look at the mess we have .
i want to make this world good .
45 days embryo &apos;s heart is beating twice as fast as the mother &apos;s .
we &apos;re actually doing the launch of two new studies of actually scanning babies &apos; brains from the moment they &apos;re born .
this is serious business . this ain &apos;t no fun .
and in 1996 , i found the answer in principles in a master spoken-word artist named reg e. gaines , who wrote the famous poem , &quot; please don &apos;t take my air jordans . &quot;
i &apos;m so experienced that when you went to a privileged school to learn a shakespearean sonnet , i was getting those beats kicked and shoved into me .
i don &apos;t need to improve any more . &quot;
and that was great .
this level of accuracy has unleashed a firestorm of innovation .
now , of course , there is a flip side to the gps dot .
then she posted her design to the web , and if you don &apos;t have time to build your own , you can buy one .
at this point , the game is over .
it &apos;s the ultimate weapon against an invasion of gps dots .
this is tamdin .
and i &apos;d snuck in -- because it &apos;s totally illegal to have a picture of the dalai lama in tibet -- it &apos;s the quickest way you can get arrested .
and in this period of time -- since that time -- as much oil , or twice as much oil as was spilled in the exxon valdez accident , was spilled in this little area of the amazon , and the tribes in this area have constantly had to move .
by the way , mengatoue was the shaman of his tribe as well .
the one i want to show you -- after we get them to make the movies , we have a night where we show the movies to the community .
knowing that she wants to stick a needle in your skin and suck out your blood ? that &apos;s awful , right ?
and this triggered us to do a remarkable experiment .
he &apos;s going back to check the control holes again , but he &apos;s coming back to the first one , and now he &apos;s locking into that smell , which means that now we can use dogs with these inspectors to much better find the breeding sites of mosquitos in the field , and therefore have a much bigger impact on malaria .
we can actually use this to contain outbreaks of mosquito-born diseases , of epidemics , right ?
so i pulled out my little pda , and i said , &quot; okay , let &apos;s look up my appointments for september 12th . &quot;
so to the folks from google , thank you .
i would tell them , &quot; hey guys , this is where i &apos;m going . this is my flight .
this is in warsaw .
this is a parking lot in elko , nevada off of route 80 at 8 : 01 p.m. on august 19th .
so by me putting all this information out there , what i &apos;m basically telling you is i &apos;m telling you everything .
no one &apos;s really going to bother you . &quot;
and everything &apos;s automated at the other end .
the technology was there .
the narratives that we use now tend to be the rise and fall of the great powers .
the other point that &apos;s worth noticing is how one-dimensional this projection is .
to paraphrase franklin roosevelt from a different context , the greatest thing we have to fear is fear itself .
but unless you learn how to mix hard power with soft power into strategies that i call smart power , you &apos;re not going to deal with the new kinds of problems that we &apos;re facing .
we had heard this story about lost gold from a gold rush-era robbery , and we wanted to go up there .
thank you .
and so i &apos;m going to take a few examples from our work .
&#91; &quot; yellow &quot; &#93; db : red . audience : yellow .
a bit more challenging , right ?
now in a sense , when we think about the effect of video games on the brain , it &apos;s very similar to the effect of wine on the health .
there are brain scientists like me that are beginning to understand what are the good ingredients in games to promote positive effects , and that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to call the broccoli side of the equation .
e : achoo !
e : &#91; bobbing head &#93; sw : let &apos;s get down for everybody . come on now .
she thinks al gore is a really good-looking man .
sw : there we go .
e : i love you .
i thought &quot; oh my god , maybe i can do the same with these boring newspapers . &quot;
and that is really amazing .
twenty-three years ago , at the age of 19 , i shot and killed a man .
now as i see it , solitary confinement is one of the most inhumane and barbaric places you can find yourself , but find myself i did .
when i got that letter from my son , i began to write a journal about things i had experienced in my childhood and in prison , and what it did is it opened up my mind to the idea of atonement .
i &apos;ve been blessed to work with some amazing men and women , helping others reenter society , and one of them is my friend named calvin evans .
but then the great famine began in 1994 .
but if i didn &apos;t believe it , i wouldn &apos;t even try , and then i would die .
at one point , my father gave up on me .
i did not come here by myself .
thank you .
my mother wanted me to be a dentist .
this is the guy that invented it , sir clive sinclair , and he &apos;s showing his machine .
last year was the biggest year .
i liked this one the best : a level 60 warlock with lots of epics for 174,000 dollars .
you need to be really an incredible artist .
a generation who may experience much more meaning through video games than they will through the real world .
as gamers we are now living by the same laws of physics in the same cities and doing many of the same things we once did in real life , only virtually .
and what was interesting about it is the obvious choice for me to talk about was graphics and audio .
and as i &apos;ve shown here , we have the audience .
give me a chair ! i want to see it , &quot; and she sat down in front of the machine , and she watched the entire washing program .
they want the washing machine in exactly the same way .
i told you . they &apos;ll go there .
and mother got time to read for me .
and i &apos;ve got malingering .
it looks like a giant hampton inn .
and i said , &quot; where &apos;d you get that from ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; yep . we accept that tony faked madness to get out of a prison sentence because his hallucinations that had seemed quite cliché to begin with just vanished the minute he got to broadmoor .
so i gave it a try . i wrote to the enron people .
he said , &quot; yeah , it &apos;s an amazing theory .
it &apos;s what all journalists do .
anyway , that was two years ago , and that &apos;s where my book ended .
i get asked all of the time from people , &quot; is it possible to really design microbial ecosystems ? &quot;
if you look at the microbes in one of the air handling units in this building , you &apos;ll see that they &apos;re all very similar to one another .
in these rooms , the air tracked the outdoor air relatively well , and when charlie saw this , he got really excited .
i don &apos;t try to say , &quot; oh , that will be a beautiful object , &quot; or something like that .
some million years after -- pshoo-shoo , bloop-bloop -- ah , wake up !
the first , if you want -- there is so many -- but one which is very easy to do , is the duty of vision .
that &apos;s why -- jump , like that ? no , don &apos;t jump .
there is different type of barbaria .
the only rule is , we have not to have any idea about the next story .
it &apos;s difficult , sometimes , to pick that one second .
i think it would be interesting to see what everyone did with a project like this .
one big clue we have is that the universe is changing with time .
you &apos;ve heard of entropy .
in every one of these books , every one of these sets of lectures , he emphasized this puzzle : why did the early universe have such a small entropy ?
einstein was fond of this idea .
he didn &apos;t know about the big bang . he didn &apos;t know about the expansion of the universe .
the good news is that , therefore , this scenario does not work ; it is not right .
so even though the universe lasts forever , there &apos;s only a finite number of things that can possibly happen in the universe .
and even better , we will understand what happened at the big bang in terms of a theory that we will be able to compare to observations .
or , you take this particular un-retouched photograph . now , interestingly enough , i get a lot of emails from people who say , &quot; is there any perceptual difference between males and females ? &quot;
wk : this is my home . this is where i live .
wk : yeah . the windmill .
wow . william , it &apos;s a real honor to have you at the ted conference .
ok , i &apos;m going to do another cut .
it doesn &apos;t have to be always dissection .
george bernard shaw said it a little differently .
but the main characteristics of romantic love are craving : an intense craving to be with a particular person , not just sexually , but emotionally .
the motor of the brain . it &apos;s a drive .
and i say back into the job market , because this is not new .
and i think that the television is like the global campfire .
and , indeed , once again we &apos;re moving forward to the kind of sexual expression that we probably saw on the grasslands of africa a million years ago , because this is the kind of sexual expression that we see in hunting and gathering societies today .
with orgasm you get a spike of dopamine .
everybody knows that .
i &apos;ve been carrying on here about the biology of love .
but more and more frequently these days i &apos;m seeing terrible things underwater as well , things that i don &apos;t think most people realize .
i thought this was going to be headline news in every media outlet , but it really wasn &apos;t , so i wanted to do a story that was a very different kind of underwater story .
and to make that point even more visual , i swam under the shrimp boat and made this picture of the guy shoveling this bycatch into the sea as trash and photographed this cascade of death , you know , animals like guitarfish , bat rays , flounder , pufferfish , that only an hour before , were on the bottom of the ocean , alive , but now being thrown back as trash .
because this is a pelagic animal and it lives out in the deeper water , and because we weren &apos;t working on the bottom , i brought along a shark cage here , and my friend , shark biologist wes pratt is inside the cage .
another charismatic megafauna species that i worked with is the story i did on the right whale .
and we can &apos;t go back and see that today , but maybe we can preserve what we have left .
i became an underwater photographer because i fell in love with the sea , and i make pictures of it today because i want to protect it , and i don &apos;t think it &apos;s too late .
every single color , dot , every single line , is a weather element .
i cherish the future .
it &apos;s the only copy i had . pieces of it .
we have a global health challenge in our hands today , and that is that the way we currently discover and develop new drugs is too costly , takes far too long , and it fails more often than it succeeds .
right here in my hand is a breathing , living human lung on a chip .
and you can see here , we can actually visualize a single white blood cell .
we &apos;re not going to ever recreate a whole human in these chips , but what our goal is is to be able to recreate sufficient functionality so that we can make better predictions of what &apos;s going to happen in humans .
they &apos;re going to help us make , instead of one of these , millions of these chips , so that we can get them into the hands of as many researchers as possible .
so makers are enthusiasts ; they &apos;re amateurs ; they &apos;re people who love doing what they do .
now the background is -- the guy who did this is a physicist .
but it was a sense of pride that we made things , that the world around us was made by us .
but these are like clubs -- they &apos;re sharing tools , sharing space , sharing expertise in what to make .
one of the coolest things is , makerbot sent out an upgrade , some new brackets for the box .
how can architects build a new world of sustainable beauty ? by learning from nature . at tedsalon in london , michael pawlyn describes three habits of nature that could transform architecture and society : radical resource efficiency , closed loops , and drawing energy from the sun .
and in nature there are lots of examples of very efficient structures based on pressurized membranes .
so it transformed a linear process into a closed-loop model , and it created more value in the process .
the way it does this is it comes out at night , crawls to the top of a sand dune , and because it &apos;s got a matte black shell , is able to radiate heat out to the night sky and become slightly cooler than its surroundings .
and the kind of synergies i &apos;m talking about are , firstly , both these technologies work very well in hot , sunny deserts .
and it &apos;s pushing the ecosystem close to collapse .
my sister and i grew up here , and we had quiet , happy childhoods .
and for those of you whose lives have been touched by mental illness , you know how challenging it can be .
but look , i said i wanted to do three things with you today .
i love the way that they see the world , because they &apos;re seeing the world for the first time .
and he even put out a book called &quot; rosey grier &apos;s needlepoint for men . &quot;
and when my dad tells the story , he says , &quot; the craziest thing was , i &apos;d never seen any of that before , except bread .
we &apos;ve got fashion magazines , house party scenes .
think about something you &apos;ve always wanted to add to your life and try it for the next 30 days .
so here &apos;s my question to you : what are you waiting for ?
the biggest crops are cotton and tobacco , and we &apos;re very proud of our bertie county peanut .
so at the time of being invited down there , we were based in san francisco , and so we were going back and forth for basically the rest of 2009 , spending about half our time in bertie county .
the first was a series of renovations of computer labs .
right now i should say , there are only 10 percent of the houses that actually have an in-home internet connection .
so the first project , which will be built next summer , is an open-air farmers &apos; market downtown , followed by bus shelters for the school bus system in the second year and home improvements for the elderly in the third year .
ultimately , design itself is a process of constant education for the people that we work with and for and for us as designers .
and where you have slightly more complex things , you can get slightly more complex things .
that &apos;s twice as long as humans have been on this planet .
so , chemistry is dominated by the electromagnetic force .
so the information spreads .
we seem to be the only species in four billion years to have this gift .
stefan sagmeister : designing with slogans
singapore was quite in discussion .
and suddenly she sees a tank ambling down the main road of sarajevo knocking everything out of its path .
they stay because you want to stay in your home .
i have to report it . &quot;
well , good morning ladies and gentlemen .
that &apos;s ok . i &apos;ll give you a shortcut for multiplying even faster on the calculator .
anyone i point to , call out a three-digit number .
let me try to take this one step further .
seven ? seven ?
1953 , and the month ?
anybody here who &apos;d like to know the day of the week they were born ?
but i &apos;d like to wrap things up now by alluding to something from earlier in the presentation .
now , let me recap .
&lt; speaker &gt; erik brynjolfsson &lt; / speaker &gt;
worldwide incomes have grown at a faster rate in the past decade than ever in history .
put them together , and we &apos;re seeing a wave of astonishing breakthroughs , like robots that do factory work or run as fast as a cheetah or leap tall buildings in a single bound .
but 17 percent of tax preparers no longer have jobs .
now , planning a complex social system is a very hard thing to do , and let me tell you a story .
if you can reduce traffic even somewhat , then congestion will go down much faster than you might think .
well , think about it this way . who changed ?
on my first day , i went to a restaurant , and i ordered a cup of green tea with sugar .
it is essential for success .
when , in contrast , two or more individuals see their choices and their outcomes as intimately connected , then they may amplify one another &apos;s success by turning choosing into a collective act .
when asked , &quot; what words and images do you associate with choice ? &quot;
the baby was delivered through a c-section , but barbara suffered cerebral anoxia , unable to breathe on her own , she was put on a ventilator .
we live entirely by the imposition of a narrative line upon disparate images , by the idea with which we have learned to freeze the shifting phantasmagoria , which is our actual experience . &quot;
and as you just mentioned , there &apos;s lots of choices out there that are very visual these days .
thank you . sheena iyengar . thank you sheena .
go get it , girl .
i want to dwell in that light with you and with everyone .
so this is a very rough attempt to think out loud .
those are the general approaches to life . that &apos;s one way to look at life on earth today .
and so , remarkably , i discovered that there &apos;s also a drift toward specialization .
but the most interesting aspect about this is that if you look at those red lines at the bottom , those indicate basically a parentage of a type of cornet that was no longer made . that does not happen in biology .
we &apos;ve heard about the japanese giving up guns .
imagine van gogh being born before the technologies of cheap oil paints .
paolo cardini : forget multitasking , try monotasking
fast-forward a generation : this is the one-room schoolhouse , oak grove , where my father went to a one-room schoolhouse .
and that night , all 90 kids -- dressed appropriately , doing their job , owning it .
fast-forward to pennsylvania , where i find myself today .
and this is the work of the student that consistently did it .
we also , like a lot of companies , create a product that &apos;s based on technology trends .
i &apos;d like to demonstrate what i mean by this by telling the story of the dvd , which is a technology which has done all of these .
that &apos;s as opposed to billions just a few years ago .
voice over ip is something you may have heard something about .
it was surprisingly non-innovative , moved very slowly , but then there was just so much fiber out there , you couldn &apos;t hold back , and look how quickly the price fell .
my father , hiding nearby , reveals himself , and was summarily taken to prison .
my european counterparts , some of them , at least , said , &quot; you can &apos;t do this .
believe me , i have been , i am , part of today &apos;s political system , and i know things must change .
twelve years ago , i was in the street writing my name to say , &quot; i exist . &quot;
two weeks after my speech , in tunisia , hundreds of portraits were made .
there are tons of school projects .
&lt; reviewer href = &quot; http : / / www.ted.com / profiles / 1108408 &quot; &gt; morton bast &lt; / reviewer &gt;
and only very rarely in very few cases does it work to use more violence .
so we all know the three o &apos;clock in the morning syndrome , when something you &apos;ve been worrying about wakes you up -- i see a lot of people -- and for an hour you toss and turn , it gets worse and worse , and by four o &apos;clock you &apos;re pinned to the pillow by a monster this big .
it was still governments telling people what to do .
dictatorships in czechoslovakia , east germany , estonia , latvia , lithuania , mali , madagascar , poland , the philippines , serbia , slovenia , i could go on , and now tunisia and egypt .
so we build a lot of things .
you don &apos;t know what they &apos;re going to learn from playing with it .
even if you don &apos;t know what the parts are , puzzling out what they might be for is a really good practice for the kids to get sort of the sense that they can take things apart , and no matter how complex they are , they can understand parts of them and that means that eventually , they can understand all of them .
it &apos;s called &quot; our choice &quot; and the author is al gore .
and as the wind starts dying down , any excess energy will be diverted back into the house -- the lights never go out .
what blows my mind when i look at it even today is that it looks almost identical to the needle in use today .
so that &apos;s a very important function tied in with the nanopatch .
and we see this kind of data .
we can push it one way , where we can take a vaccine that works but is too expensive and can get protection with a hundredth of the dose compared to the needle .
so we &apos;ve commenced this particular journey , and we &apos;ve commenced this journey in an unusual way .
but here in the united states , we ramp up the drama a little bit , and we drop our pots into sawdust , which catches on fire , and you take a garbage pail , and you put it on top , and smoke starts pouring out .
jb : it &apos;s so powerful . richard ford , who &apos;s won the pulitzer prize , says that dyslexia helped him write sentences .
on 9 / 11 , joel wasn &apos;t in new york . he was out of town , but he raced back to the city , and raced down to the site of the destruction .
it &apos;s more than a hundred years old and you can still see the fingermarks where the potter pinched it .
think of the space that we spend most of our time .
but because it &apos;s flexible , it can be on any surface whatsoever .
18 years ago , i saw a photograph in the paper .
so the scene : the sky is filled with this fleet of helicopters carrying him in .
fair enough .
we know more about mobile operating systems , but what we really need is a moral operating system .
take a number , any number -- two .
but don &apos;t give up .
there are things that are intrinsically wrong -- like lying is wrong , like torturing innocent children is wrong .
in fact , let &apos;s start right now .
you &apos;re thinking about the relevance of 17th century french theater -- how does that bear upon venture capital ?
&lt; speaker &gt; mary roach &lt; / speaker &gt;
she said that the last time she had done it was on the disneyland tram .
days went by . at a certain point , the man , still hiccupping , had sex with his wife .
okay .
so we thought , let &apos;s not mention the clitoris right now . &quot;
and in fact he found that in three quarters of the men the stuff just kind of slopped out .
the tree was in part a catalyst for the project .
so with the help of some biologists studying the fungus , i got some maps and some gps coordinates and chartered a plane and started looking for the death rings , the circular patterns in which the fungus kills the trees .
this is the fortingall yew -- no , i &apos;m just kidding -- this is the fortingall yew .
this plant is called the welwitschia , and it lives only in parts of coastal namibia and angola , where it &apos;s uniquely adapted to collect moisture from mist coming off the sea .
and there &apos;s some younger clones dotting the landscape behind it .
i &apos;m here to talk about very real killer robots , autonomous combat drones .
now , i think , knowing this , we can take decisive steps to preserve our democratic institutions , to do what humans do best , which is adapt .
now you might be thinking that citizens of high-tech nations would have the advantage in any robotic war , that citizens of those nations would be less vulnerable , particularly against developing nations .
if we have an international treaty on robotic weapons , how do we gain the benefits of autonomous drones and vehicles while still protecting ourselves against illegal robotic weapons ?
all of them , however , including myself , as we walk underneath those strange stone gargoyles just down the road , feel that we &apos;ve become less than the sum of our parts , feel as though we have become profoundly diminished .
we need to get away from feeling , in the same way , human rights matters because of the other things it brings , or women &apos;s rights matters for the other things it brings .
&lt; speaker &gt; christien meindertsma &lt; / speaker &gt;
well , that &apos;s what the producer says : it &apos;s &quot; improving the dough , of course . &quot;
injectable collagen -- or , since the &apos; 70s , collagen from pigs -- has been used for injecting into wrinkles .
and you might think i &apos;m very fond of pigs , but actually -- well , i am a little bit -- but i &apos;m more fond of raw materials in general .
and i mean that in its fullest sense of the word .
and for norden as well , this device had incredible moral importance , because norden was a committed christian .
secondly , it breaks down a lot .
so why do we talk about the norden bombsight ?
or take the battle in afghanistan .
&lt; speaker &gt; sarah-jayne blakemore &lt; / speaker &gt;
so you don &apos;t have to ask any of these guys .
they &apos;re parodied , sometimes even demonized in the media for their kind of typical teenage behavior . they take risks , they &apos;re sometimes moody , they &apos;re very self-conscious .
there &apos;s an ancient and universal concept that words have power , that spells exist , and that if we could only pronounce the right words , then -- whooosh -- you know , an avalanche would come and wipe out the hobbits , right ? so this is a very attractive idea because we &apos;re very lazy , like the sorcerer &apos;s apprentice , or the world &apos;s greatest computer programmer .
so you get 250 of these in the mail in little tubes .
i heard their prayer and ate their bread .
what do we know about the death threats by the taliban nailed on the doors of the people who dare to send their daughters to school as in balkh ?
so the question is , how are we going to fix this ?
and everyone kind of sat at the table .
if you ask men why they did a good job , they &apos;ll say , &quot; i &apos;m awesome .
the saddest thing about all of this is that it &apos;s really hard to remember this .
and if that wasn &apos;t good enough motivation for everyone out there , they also have more -- how shall i say this on this stage ? -- they know each other more in the biblical sense as well .
they &apos;re just not moving .
i tend to win those arguments , because i know the tricks .
that &apos;s the kind of argument we want .
but cognitively , now -- just from a cognitive point of view -- who was the winner ?
raghava kk : shake up your story
i have to tell you about my childhood .
you know , i &apos;m making a very important argument .
by a rate of two to one , the children who had died had had mothers who had been x-rayed when pregnant .
that means we have to resist the neurobiological drive , which means that we really prefer people mostly like ourselves , and it means we have to seek out people with different backgrounds , different disciplines , different ways of thinking and different experience , and find ways to engage with them .
so , he didn &apos;t really want to say anything .
i &apos;m a very lucky person .
but technology alone isn &apos;t enough .
it &apos;s freezing cold , and that thin air really gets you .
when it comes to supplements , should you be taking them ?
deprive your brain of oxygen for just a few minutes , those brain cells die , they never come back .
it &apos;s actually a bronze age culture that &apos;s been isolated .
and one sixth the rate of cardiovascular disease .
there is our work life , where we &apos;re productive .
and they follow five little habits that conveys to them extraordinary longevity , comparatively speaking .
and predictably , perhaps , on the fourth day he ended up in the operating room .
they don &apos;t have any conveniences .
they were either born into or they proactively surrounded themselves with the right people .
&lt; speaker &gt; paul kemp-robertson &lt; / speaker &gt;
&quot; sub-prime pedaling . &quot; &quot; barclays takes you for a ride . &quot;
it &apos;s 50 percent above the category average .
you know , you think about , brands are starting to fill the gaps .
this is me building a prototype for six hours straight .
and we gave them away to all the tedsters .
this is a completely programmable and adaptive pipe on its own .
and it &apos;s full of many little trivial end points , like there &apos;s a little foot here that just drags around in circles and it doesn &apos;t really mean anything .
this kind of work is also very much like puppetry , where the found object is , in a sense , the puppet , and i &apos;m the puppeteer at first , because i &apos;m playing with an object .
so , it &apos;s sort of related , but you can see it &apos;s much more overtly erotic .
so i would never win the race because i &apos;m always stopping .
hp : yr : if i may , i would like to tell you a little bit about myself and my artwork .
yr : good advice , but i still think that we learn who we are by copying others .
so every time i fail to become more like my father , i become more like myself .
our right human hemisphere is all about this present moment .
you muscles , you relax . &quot;
i gotta focus . &quot;
and so i say to him -- clear in my mind , i say to him : &quot; this is jill ! i need help ! &quot;
or , i can choose to step into the consciousness of my left hemisphere , where i become a single individual , a solid . separate from the flow , separate from you . i am dr. jill bolte taylor : intellectual , neuroanatomist . these are the &quot; we &quot; inside of me .
is there anything companies can do to make their employees feel less pressed for time ? yes .
and as a woman who didn &apos;t get married until i was a lot older -- and i &apos;m glad i waited -- -- and has no children , i look at these young people and i say , &quot; your job is not to be perfect .
they said they would try so hard to remember the fragments of the dance , hoping that others were alive and doing the same .
and together they started a book club for a hundred people in the slums , and they &apos;re reading many ted authors and liking it .
born and raised in baltimore , he studied real estate , worked in commercial real estate , and after 9 / 11 decided he was going to pakistan to make a difference .
and she said , &quot; dr. coles , i am not talking ; i &apos;m praying . &quot;
i was amputated at age one , and i &apos;ve been running like hell ever since , all over the place .
we all saw how hard you were working . &quot;
why don &apos;t you just tell them ?
so , here we are , a week after the olympics and down at atlanta , and i &apos;m just blown away by the fact that just a year ago , i got out on a gravel track and couldn &apos;t run 50 meters .
and my fastest time , which was the world record , was 15.77 .
that &apos;s the achievement , i think . that &apos;s the real achievement .
ss : are you a different height ?
i mean , i love the fact that i can go in anywhere and pick out what i want -- the shoes i want , the skirts i want -- and i &apos;m hoping to try to bring these over here and make them accessible to a lot of people .
they didn &apos;t even want to touch that one . they just did it .
now if you don &apos;t know what hypomania is , it &apos;s like an engine that &apos;s out of control , maybe a ferrari engine , with no breaks .
and you &apos;ll see why 1984 won &apos;t be like &quot; 1984 . &quot;
so we assume that the internet is a border-busting technology .
so what we need to recognize is that if we want to have a citizen-centric internet in the future , we need a broader and more sustained internet freedom movement .
they must be identical to each other .
and my daughter -- oh , surely she is extra-intelligent . &quot;
that &apos;s the first day at the hole in the wall .
so i left them for a couple of months .
the scores jumped to 50 percent .
we take our children , we make them shut their brains down , and then we say , &quot; perform . &quot;
it &apos;s about letting it happen .
so what &apos;s my wish ?
i think it was good advice .
this is an explorer of the unseen world , martinus beijerinck .
and there &apos;s a lot of it .
very often when i meet someone and they learn this about me , there &apos;s a certain kind of awkwardness .
the sketches are in black and white here , but in my mind they have colors .
what about 75 ?
in the case of hare , it &apos;s an ambiguous sound in english .
and this is what i saw when i looked out of the window .
but then something good happened .
this is in montana , 2008 .
so i &apos;ll conclude to invite you all to dead duck day .
we have already an autonomous vehicle .
but the problem is this : how do we convey this information and instructions to a person who cannot see fast enough and accurate enough so he can drive ?
this simulator was also very useful for training the blind drivers and also quickly testing different types of ideas for different types of non-visual user interfaces .
but still , will the society , would they accept such a radical idea ?
for example , this is the oldest operating room in the western world , in london , where the operating room is actually on top of a church with a skylight coming in .
and we wait .
so here in this situation , if you make a solution full of this three-part molecule along with the dye , which is shown in green , and you inject it into the vein of someone who has cancer , normal tissue can &apos;t cut it .
so what that means is if the lymph node did not have cancer , the woman would be saved from having unnecessary surgery .
that &apos;s a lot of people to have a lot of problems -- and this is even in so-called nerve-sparing surgery , which means that the surgeon is aware of the problem , and they are trying to avoid the nerves .
so here &apos;s a tumor .
it is not an event for the solo runner .
but if you go to santee alley , yeah .
the courts have said over and over again , &quot; you don &apos;t need any more intellectual property protection . &quot;
now of course , there &apos;s a bunch of effects that this culture of copying has on the creative process .
but if you take a look at the two other biggest markets in the world , it turns out that the protection that &apos;s offered is really ineffectual .
hairdos , no copyright protection .
or is it a physically fixed expression of an idea : something that somebody made and they deserve to own it for a while and make money from it ?
here is one example . this is a train which goes from london to paris .
and you get a far lower risk of famine , because you actually had two crops to fall back on , not one .
all value is actually relative .
if you think about it , shakerism was a proto-environmental movement .
fish and chips in newspaper , the cornish pasty , the pie , the sandwich .
now this is the most perfect case of creating intangible , added value , without changing the product in the slightest .
if you think it &apos;s funny , bear in mind there is an organization called the american institute of wine economics , which actually does extensive research into perception of things , and discovers that except for among perhaps five or ten percent of the most knowledgeable people , there is no correlation between quality and enjoyment in wine , except when you tell the people how expensive it is , in which case they tend to enjoy the more expensive stuff more .
and after about five long years my family had me deprogrammed .
and how i &apos;ve come to view what happened to me is a viral , memetic infection .
i &apos;m actually going to share something with you i haven &apos;t talked about probably in more than 10 years .
that &apos;s another story we won &apos;t even get into .
and i had a white cane in one hand and a suitcase full of medical records in another hand .
and a former teacher who happened to have alzheimer &apos;s took on the task of teaching me to write .
so everything is different when you &apos;re a sighted person because you take that for granted .
i hope to become a vet when i grow up so that i can take care of stray cats and dogs who wander around the streets of the village that i live near gilgit , northern pakistan .
and if our fates are intertwined , then we believe that it is good karma , it is good fortune .
it &apos;s not a typical mindset for most americans , but it is perforce typical of virtually all hungarians .
and then resumed the beating .
and two months later when the main plant opened and hundreds of new workers , white and black , poured in to see the facility for the first time , they were met by the 16 foremen , white and black , standing shoulder to shoulder .
&quot; yo napot , sandor ! &quot;
it is this inextinguishable , undaunted appetite for learning and experience , no matter how risible , no matter how esoteric , no matter how seditious it might seem .
and so because of that belief that i think needs to be burst , i &apos;m here to send us all hurtling back to the truth .
&quot; oh , it &apos;s very easy . it &apos;s the western world and it &apos;s the developing world , &quot; they say .
so we have countries living there .
that &apos;s why we are so scared about flu , isn &apos;t it ?
we could actually go to mayflower to eisenhower , and that would be put together into a developing world , which is rightly growing its cities in a very amazing way , which have great entrepreneurs , but also have the collapsing countries .
and on this axis , gdp .
and that doesn &apos;t come easy from the mouth of a swedish public health professor .
and third chance for sweden , against brazil here .
but you also see that there are african countries down here .
this is the epidemic in mozambique . this is an epidemic in northern tanzania .
there was a beaten up black and white television flickering in the background , and a former head of state and general was being blindfolded and tied to the pole .
but maybe it was time to prove to myself , yes , it &apos;s important to understand the past , it is important to look at it in a different light , but maybe we should look at the strengths in our own culture and build on those foundations in the present .
the sounds of the voices were harmonious .
and they actually use the nintendo wii remote .
and why this is interesting is that if you put on , say , a pair of safety glasses , that have two infrared dots in them , what these two dots are essentially going to give you is , give the computer an approximation of your head location .
i had some issues when i was coming up , and my mother would always tell me , she &apos;s like , &quot; you know , if you don &apos;t get this together , i &apos;m going to send you to military school . &quot;
i didn &apos;t ever feel like i was in danger .
they signed for a whole collection of different reasons .
and those were the ones who were even curious enough to say anything .
&lt; speaker &gt; michael metcalfe &lt; / speaker &gt;
in the context of this auditorium , the front two rows aren &apos;t going to get any food .
so following that conversation with my daughter , and seeing the absence of inflation in the face of money-printing , and knowing that international aid payments were falling at just the wrong time , this made me wonder : could we match but just on a much grander scale ?
but you know what , that &apos;s the point of a matching scheme .
if we couple the first two -- the body and the metabolism -- we can come up with a system that could perhaps move and replicate , and if we coupled these now to inheritable information , we can come up with a system that would be more lifelike , and would perhaps evolve .
certain kind of molecules like to associate with the clay . for example , in this case , rna , shown in red -- this is a relative of dna , it &apos;s an informational molecule -- it can come along and it starts to associate with the surface of this clay .
right ? so not only do individual protocells have behavior , what we &apos;ve interpreted as behavior in this system , but we also have basically population-level behavior similar to what organisms have .
you needed to get life out of this junk that is present on the early earth , four , 4.5 billion years ago .
so by making these chemical , artificial life experiments , we hope not only to understand something fundamental about the origin of life and the existence of life on this planet , but also what possible life there could be out there in the universe . thank you .
and then of course , this year we &apos;ve been responding to katrina , as well as following up on our reconstruction works .
so we &apos;ve engaged not just designers , but also , you know , a whole variety of technology-based professionals .
and you have to keep the maintenance down .
but what we &apos;re known probably most for is dealing with disasters and development , and we &apos;ve been involved in a lot of issues , such as the tsunami and also things like hurricane katrina .
this is a utility room for a woman who is on a walker .
and this is just a selection of things that were built in the last couple of years .
as soon as that is built , anyone in africa or any developing nation can take the construction documents and replicate it for free .
my mom once said , there &apos;s nothing worse than being all mouth and no trousers .
we don &apos;t want to do that to our students .
and think about some of the things that we &apos;re learning about cellular mechanics .
so i have a gift i want to share with you today , a project i &apos;m working on called happiness revealed , and it &apos;ll give us a glimpse into that perspective from the point of view of a child and an elderly man of that world .
&lt; reviewer href = &quot; http : / / www.ted.com / profiles / 1108408 &quot; &gt; morton bast &lt; / reviewer &gt;
he and i have both been exploring caves a long time and we &apos;ve been climbing mountains a long time , but neither one of us had ever really explored a glacier cave before .
there &apos;s our camp on the left side of this entrance room .
so i work in marketing , which i love , but my first passion was physics , a passion brought to me by a wonderful school teacher , when i had a little less gray hair .
and if you think about the number of people who claim in surveys to regularly look for porn on the web , it &apos;s very few .
but then you lose control of it .
did you know rats that ate genetically engineered corn had developed signs of liver and kidney toxicity ?
my little cousin told his dad that he would rather have the organic toasted o &apos;s cereal because birke said he shouldn &apos;t eat sparkly cereal .
thank you frans de waal , wherever you are , i love you and i &apos;d give anything to meet you .
i &apos;d like to play you some voices of little girls from the two-and-a-half years of research that we did -- actually , some of the voices are more recent .
and you can see how we &apos;ve tried to incorporate the issues that matter to them in the game that we &apos;ve created .
i want to make the point that what we &apos;re giving girls , i think , through this effort , is a kind of validation , a sense of being seen .
when i asked people their associations with the wheelchair , they used words like &quot; limitation , &quot; &quot; fear , &quot; &quot; pity &quot; and &quot; restriction . &quot;
&lt; reviewer href = &quot; http : / / www.ted.com / profiles / 1108408 &quot; &gt; morton bast &lt; / reviewer &gt;
the third world is connected , we are connected .
they are shaping the way we consume .
this looks like a giant hamburger .
so the idea was pretty simple .
well i believe that in any context anywhere , he always has the choice at least not to do a cartoon that will feed hatred .
and so she set about to make it so .
our printing press is the internet . our coffee houses are social networks .
in my own field of investigative journalism , we &apos;re also having to start thinking globally , so this is a site called investigative dashboard . and if you &apos;re trying to track a dictator &apos;s assets , for example , hosni mubarak , you know , he &apos;s just funneling out cash from his country when he knows he &apos;s in trouble , and what you want to do to investigate that is , you need to have access to all of the world &apos;s , as many as you can , companies &apos; house registrations databases .
skepticism , because you must always be challenging .
they &apos;ve kidded out the house with cctv cameras .
the first two are the macrobot and decibot .
so you could have something that climbs along and reads it and can output at one to one .
it &apos;s biodegradable . it &apos;s reusable .
and through doing this , we &apos;ve learned some absolutely fascinating things .
i mean , i have things at the back of my refrigerator that have been there for years , all right ?
so we need to design things like this far better if we &apos;re going to start addressing serious environmental problems .
he &apos;s also watching television .
so imagine if , when you bought your mobile phone , your new one because you replaced your old one -- after 15 to 18 months is the average time that people replace their phones , by the way — so if we &apos;re going to keep this kind of expedient mobile phone replacing , then we should be looking at closing the loop on these systems .
there are many different kinds of mess .
i &apos;ve been looking at these things for so long .
now a lung is something very strange .
now , here is another thing which is rather interesting .
the eiffel tower has a fractal aspect .
it was very easy , and you can write many books very fast about it .
but then the computer came , and i decided to apply the computer , not to new problems in mathematics -- like this wiggle wiggle , that &apos;s a new problem -- but to old problems .
bottomless wonders spring from simple rules , which are repeated without end .
i spent most of my time at a small outpost called restrepo .
first of all , the experience is very bizarre , it &apos;s a very bizarre one .
it was machine gun fire .
he missed , in some ways , the opposite of killing .
in world war ii , there were many stories of soldiers who were wounded , were brought to a rear base hospital , who went awol , crawled out of windows , slipped out doors , went awol , wounded , to make their way back to the front lines to rejoin their brothers out there .
this was a tragedy , but it really forced us to refocus what it is that we were doing .
again , you have an 18-year-old boy who graduates high school in kansas city .
my whole right side was ripped open , filled with gravel .
they took out two of my broken ribs , and they rebuilt my back , l1 , they rebuilt it , they took out another broken rib , they fused t12 , l1 and l2 together .
well , there wasn &apos;t much else to do in the spinal ward , so we did .
gone . &quot;
i said , &quot; pass me the yellow pages . &quot;
so he got over to the runway , and he applied the power .
and then i thought , &quot; why stop there ?
but one late night , when i was compiling the report i really realized my discovery . i have shown that swedish top students know statistically significantly less about the world than the chimpanzees .
this is india . indonesia &apos;s moving on pretty fast .
and you have the oecd there , and you have sub-saharan africa there , and we take off the arab states there , coming both from africa and from asia , and we put them separately , and we can expand this axis , and i can give it a new dimension here , by adding the social values there , child survival .
i would like to compare south korea , which is this one , with brazil , which is this one . the label went away for me here . and i would like to compare uganda , which is there . and i can run it forward , like this .
some countries accept that their databases can go out on the world , but what we really need is , of course , a search function .
and it &apos;s a new technology coming in , but then amazingly , how well it fits to the economy of the countries . that &apos;s why the 100 dollar computer will be so important . but it &apos;s a nice tendency .
and what is happening today is , in one sense , frightening because it &apos;s never happened before .
and if you look , you can see them happening , already beginning to emerge .
you see india , you see brazil .
i suspect we are now reaching the end of 400 years when western power was enough .
i was a young soldier in the last of the small empire wars of britain .
collective security is not enough .
they &apos;re the dominant builders and to a large extent , the dominant designers .
julian treasure : i call this the mixer .
and i started to write down on these little note cards every time i heard something that struck a chord in me , pardon the pun , or something that i thought i could use , and pretty soon , my studio looked like this , kind of like a john nash , &quot; beautiful mind &quot; vibe .
there were no samples in this record , although i did look up on the internet last night , i mean several months ago , that &quot; la di da di &quot; means , it &apos;s an old cockney expression from the late 1800s in england , so maybe a remix with mrs. patmore from &quot; downton abbey &quot; coming soon , or that &apos;s for another day .
we &apos;re getting away from the obscure samples that we were doing , and all of a sudden everyone &apos;s taking these massive &apos; 80s tunes like bowie , &quot; let &apos;s dance , &quot; and all these disco records , and just rapping on them .
so i hope you enjoy this . here we go .
and 60 seconds is the amount of time it took for it to travel 250 kilometers to managua .
and that was the job of the journalist . it was filtering all this stuff .
there was only one video posted to that account , and the username was rita krill .
so that was the only one that gave us a clue .
we have algorithms that are smarter than ever before , and computers that are quicker than ever before .
even the idea of us as a family was challenging to most people .
well , i thought i had the answer to that one , and i said , &quot; skin color . &quot;
and when i realized and really understood that my self is a projection and that it has a function , a funny thing happened .
and i would like to tell you a few personal stories about what i like to call &quot; the danger of the single story . &quot;
and so we had , as was the norm , live-in domestic help , who would often come from nearby rural villages .
although i still get quite irritable when africa is referred to as a country , the most recent example being my otherwise wonderful flight from lagos two days ago , in which there was an announcement on the virgin flight about the charity work in &quot; india , africa and other countries . &quot;
i realized that i had been so immersed in the media coverage of mexicans that they had become one thing in my mind , the abject immigrant .
and most of all , a kind of normalized political fear invaded our lives .
what if my roommate knew about the female lawyer who recently went to court in nigeria to challenge a ridiculous law that required women to get their husband &apos;s consent before renewing their passports ?
i hope you will enjoy .
they could not tell you about the ink of their own love letters .
so i &apos;d like to start by focusing on the world &apos;s most dangerous animal .
now the odd thing is , is that once you &apos;ve been bitten by this mosquito , and you &apos;ve had this disease , your body develops antibodies , so if you &apos;re bitten again with that strain , it doesn &apos;t affect you .
now in an urban environment , that &apos;s extraordinarily difficult .
but you don &apos;t want to get all of the insects .
and then we &apos;ve gone out into the big outdoors , always with local community consent , always with the necessary permits .
and i &apos;m in favor , actually . of course i am .
so in this situation too , to decode the information contained in patterns like this , watching alone won &apos;t do .
and the approach , of course , also works in moving , behaving animals .
so we set out to identify the cells in the fly &apos;s brain that played the role of the critic .
if the connection is weak , the motors will stay off and the fly will continue straight on its course .
in may of 2010 , at 35 years old , with a two-year-old at home and my second child on the way , i was diagnosed with a large aneurysm at the base of my thoracic aorta .
she &apos;s going to be four years old , and anyone who knows a four-year-old knows that they love to ask , &quot; why ? &quot;
dry areas cover more than one third of the earth &apos;s land surfaces .
if you happen to live close to the desert border , you can pretty much calculate how long it will be before you have to carry your kids away , and abandon your home and your life as you know it .
a chemical process produces calcite , which is a kind of natural cement that binds the grains together .
that &apos;s not true at all .
there are 4,000 miles of dewatered streams in montana alone .
if you include all the drain , it takes more than a hundred pints of water to make a pint of beer .
he gets paid to leave the water in the stream .
every japanese kid learns how to fold that crane .
the first law is two-colorability . you can color any crease pattern with just two colors without ever having the same color meeting .
what &apos;s the most abstract form ? it &apos;s a stick figure .
if i put the flap on the edge , it uses a half circle of paper .
these techniques revolutionized this art .
surprisingly , origami and the structures that we &apos;ve developed in origami turn out to have applications in medicine , in science , in space , in the body , consumer electronics and more .
so they looked into the origami community , we got in touch with them , and i started working with them .
the thing is , that this often happens in math and science .
give judges a list of mandatory sentences to impose for crimes , so that you don &apos;t need to rely on judges using their judgment .
well if you think about it , it &apos;s really hard to measure out round columns using a ruler .
he robbed him at gunpoint .
ms. dewey &apos;s a teacher in a texas elementary school .
and it doesn &apos;t have to be this way .
it was a court only for veterans who had broken the law .
we &apos;ll see .
so , i &apos;d like to tell you something about the story of these extra dimensions .
and that is what got kaluza thinking .
now , the first question was answered in 1926 by a fellow named oskar klein .
well , it &apos;s a theory that tries to answer the question : what are the basic , fundamental , indivisible , uncuttable constituents making up everything in the world around us ?
when you study the mathematics of string theory , you find that it doesn &apos;t work in a universe that just has three dimensions of space .
this is an example of something known as a calabi-yau shape -- name isn &apos;t all that important .
so , imagine we have a certain kind of particle called a graviton -- that &apos;s the kind of debris we expect to be ejected out , if the extra dimensions are real .
and , more than that , whatever is on your brain should come out of your mouth .
i had christian bibles .
but it was really interesting , because i was able to make some progress , because i couldn &apos;t believe how much my behavior changed my thoughts .
it &apos;s not a book that was written and came down from on high .
this one was unexpected because i started the year as an agnostic , and by the end of the year , i became what a friend of mine calls a reverent agnostic , which i love .
this one was very unexpected because , you know , i grew up with the scientific worldview , and i was shocked learning how much of my life is governed by irrational forces .
&lt; speaker &gt; kate stone &lt; / speaker &gt;
and we &apos;d do that by building fences , using motorbikes and horses , and the sheep would make their way all the way back to the shearing shed for the different seasons .
that &apos;s always the case .
and i think , kind of like going back to the farm , it &apos;s about how to let people do what you want them to do rather than making people do what you want them to do .
but it &apos;s not about the technology .
mayor bloomberg came in office , he was very supportive , but we still had to make the economic case .
but what really , i think , makes the high line special is the people .
and amongst the chaos , amidst the euphoria , it took me a little while to understand that some of the people who had wielded power before 1989 , in eastern europe , continued to do so after the revolutions there .
and what i noticed at the beginning of my research that the balkans had turned into a vast transit zone for illicit goods and services coming from all over the world .
and it &apos;s the fastest thing on european waters .
let me go on to the 101 of international organized crime now .
i would like to introduce you to mr. pringle .
you don &apos;t have to sleep with prostitutes or take drugs in order to have a relationship with organized crime .
we really have to ask the question : can the world sustain that number of automobiles ?
but it tells us that we know how to create it , we know how to create it cost effectively , we know how to handle it safely .
and i tell them i sleep like a baby : i wake up crying every two hours .
one way around this is to draw pictures .
if we unwind the double helix and unzip the two strands , you see these things that look like teeth .
all this field of view is a single strand of dna .
these things that look like whiskers that are sticking out from either side are the dynamic scaffolding of the cell .
but most medical researchers -- discovering the stuff is simply steps along the path to the big goals , which are to eradicate disease , to eliminate the suffering and the misery that disease causes and to lift people out of poverty .
we were so much bigger than coca-cola in those days .
again , education , class entertainment .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t worry . come over and i &apos;ll do the whole lot of you . &quot;
so they were happy with that .
but i have some to give out afterward .
the money goes from the company into the village via tree-planting .
and we use vegetables around the school ground , so they raise their own vegetables .
what &apos;s in its universe of attendant virtues ?
but he says that he has yet to experience someone who became more aware of their body , in all its frailty and its grace , without , at the same time , becoming more compassionate towards all of life .
but here &apos;s a face from 20th century science that might surprise you in a discussion about compassion .
and i want to say that it is a liberating thing to realize that that is no obstacle to compassion -- following on what fred luskin says -- that these flaws just make us human .
till a couple months later , i went back to the same airport -- same plane , i think -- and looked up , and it said c .
and &quot; the end of print &quot; is now in its fifth printing .
so , this was the contents page originally .
and my guess is that a lot of the surf kids did go to the site to get this entire picture .
and we were trying to say that , hey , some of these guys that work there are actually ok ; some of them actually have friends and family , and they &apos;re not all awful people .
i suppose you could eventually decode it , but it &apos;s really not very well written ; it really wouldn &apos;t be worthwhile .
this i saw on the plane , flying in , for hot new products .
and i started thinking about some of these decisions i have to make between , like , serif versus san-serif .
and when you realize that the casque of the turtle looks like an urban tessitura , and can we imagine , if we cut the casque of the turtle , how sad she &apos;s going to be ?
you can come when you are in curitiba and have a coffee there .
so , all the ideas about how to transform through design -- old quarries and open universities and botanic garden -- all of it &apos;s related to how we teach the children .
that means me , with some focal ideas to help the normal process of planning .
and i thought , you know , i am a storyteller .
well , you know that situation where you get an evaluation from your boss , and she tells you 37 things you do really awesome , and one thing -- an &quot; opportunity for growth ? &quot;
and i kind of got a handle on it .
and the last was they had connection , and -- this was the hard part -- as a result of authenticity , they were willing to let go of who they thought they should be in order to be who they were , which you have to absolutely do that for connection .
she said , &quot; what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
it was funny , i sent something out on twitter and on facebook that says , &quot; how would you define vulnerability ?
the more afraid we are , the more vulnerable we are , the more afraid we are .
because when we work from a place , i believe , that says , &quot; i &apos;m enough , &quot; then we stop screaming and start listening , we &apos;re kinder and gentler to the people around us , and we &apos;re kinder and gentler to ourselves .
i thought my idea was pretty good , but his idea is genius , and at the time , i knew his idea was better than mine , but i just couldn &apos;t explain why .
okay . now , what would the perfect experience look like on the five senses graph ?
now , when we look at these three ideas together , you &apos;ll notice that the five senses theory doesn &apos;t only change the way we use these products but also the way they look .
now , i know that many of you don &apos;t stop to think about diversity in agricultural systems and , let &apos;s face it , that &apos;s logical .
find it . make sure it doesn &apos;t join the list . &quot;
the coldest growing seasons of the future , hotter than the hottest of the past .
unfortunately , these seed banks are located around the world in buildings and they &apos;re vulnerable .
there are now a couple of security doors , so you won &apos;t see it quite like this .
i can &apos;t look you in the eyes and tell you that i have a simple solution for that , but i can look you in the eyes and tell you that we can &apos;t solve any of those problems if we don &apos;t have crop diversity .
if you &apos;re crossing the street , you have sidewalk cutouts .
it &apos;s the person that &apos;s sliding his hands up and down the levers , so the mechanism itself can be very simple and composed of bicycle parts you can get anywhere in the world .
the road was too rough .
we don &apos;t know how to follow the narrative .
and astute clinicians tracked that down , and what they found was they were carrying mutations .
six months ago , we locked down the screening key for this decoder .
it &apos;s a journey into the foreign territory of somebody else &apos;s life , a journey , an exploration that can take you places you never dreamed of going and still can &apos;t quite believe you &apos;ve been , especially if , like me , you &apos;re an agnostic jew and the life you &apos;ve been exploring is that of muhammad .
fear was the only sane response , the only human response .
but one thing is sure : call it human .
so every two weeks , we will be making about 5,000 new components to fit to the car .
was this a predictable event ?
it is displaying data that exists already in a different way , to amplify it , to provide cues to the doctors , to the nurses , so they can see what &apos;s happening .
and it makes a very bad microphone ; i &apos;ve tried it many times .
i &apos;m an actor who plays a specific part .
and she didn &apos;t answer the damn question !
now , these people will make guesses , they &apos;ll say things like , &quot; why am i getting electricity ?
because , the bottom line is , the sponsors love it , and he will expose her to television publicity all the time .
she couldn &apos;t reach me . now she says she doesn &apos;t want to reach me because i &apos;m a godless person .
it &apos;s exactly equivalent to taking one 325 milligram aspirin tablet , throwing it into the middle of lake tahoe , and then stirring it up , obviously with a very big stick , and waiting two years or so until the solution is homogeneous .
but at the same time , as arthur c. clarke said , the rotting of the human mind , the business of believing in the paranormal and the occult and the supernatural -- all of this total nonsense , this medieval thinking -- i think something should be done about that , and it all lies in education .
twenty-five-and-a-quarter years ago i read a newspaper article which said that one day syringes would be one of the major causes of the spread of aids , the transmission of aids .
in all schools in indonesia , there is usually a toy seller in the playground .
this is my wife and collaborator , rupal .
so we &apos;re going to cruise through half a year in about 40 seconds .
this is a moment , one moment captured across multiple cameras .
that &apos;s where those big peaks are over to the left .
each of the links that you &apos;re seeing rendered here is an actual connection made between something someone said and a piece of content .
he &apos;s five years old . he &apos;s not going to understand this . &quot;
and then when i went through that big , horrible breakup with carl and i couldn &apos;t get off the couch , i listened to your song , &quot; now that i don &apos;t have you , &quot; over and over and over and over again .
yeah , stuff like that was in the movie and she &apos;s promoting it .
if you get too engrossed and involved and concerned in regard to the things over which you have no control , it will adversely affect the things over which you have control .
and i may say , i may not see the church , or hear the word or eat the food their hands may grow .
when i speak at coaching clinics , i often tell young coaches -- and at coaching clinics , more or less , they &apos;ll be the younger coaches getting in the profession .
and we forget there is no progress without change .
and no one can do more than that .

have i rambled enough ?
it was only when alex passed away that i realized that the eyelids , in some sense , were my own , and having done so much to allow me to learn to see , alex in his own way was saying goodbye .
my thinking is , you probably have to go a long way back .
it taught me -- it gave me a greater appreciation , an understanding for the present moment .
now , what usually happens when we &apos;re learning to be mindful is that we get distracted by a thought .

marisa fick-jordan : the wonder of zulu wire art
surgeon and writer sherwin nuland meditates on the idea of hope -- the desire to become our better selves and make a better world . it &apos;s a thoughtful 12 minutes that will help you focus on the road ahead .
and i find that very interesting and very provocative , because what you &apos;ve been hearing in the last couple of days is the sense of going in different directions : directions that are specific and unique to problems .
now , we all think that shelley obviously is the great romantic poet that he was ; many of us tend to forget that he wrote some perfectly wonderful essays , too , and the most well-remembered essay is one called &quot; a defence of poetry . &quot;
i suspect he never really said this , because we don &apos;t know what hippocrates really said , but we do know for sure that one of the great greek physicians said the following , and it has been recorded in one of the books attributed to hippocrates , and the book is called &quot; precepts . &quot;
we &apos;re not just talking about a few videos , we &apos;re talking about over 100 years of video every day , between new uploads and the legacy scans we regularly do across all of the content on the site .
it &apos;s not uncommon for a single video to have multiple rights owners .
and then , when i returned to work full time , in this role , i joined with wonderful colleagues who were also interested in these questions .
mike degruy : hooked by an octopus
if you walked up to an octopus tank , especially early in the morning before anyone arrived , the octopus would rise up and look at you and you &apos;re thinking , &quot; is that guy really looking at me ? he is looking at me ! &quot;
and apparently , evolution had occurred at a pretty rapid rate on one tree , between the time they named it and the time i arrived , because i &apos;m sure there were at least three trees on that island when we were there .

if there &apos;s 3.5 billion now , it &apos;s going to be six billion then it &apos;s going to be 10 billion .
but if you can take this big , massive thing , and you could turn it into a million little things -- something like a flock of birds -- well then the radar that &apos;s looking for that has to be able to see every flock of birds in the sky .
all of a sudden , nine percent just goes away , and nobody to this day can even agree on what happened because nobody ordered it , nobody asked for it .
it &apos;s trying to get a grasp on you , on the firmware inside the human skull , so that it can recommend what movie you might want to watch next -- which is a very , very difficult problem .
it &apos;s because the elevator is missing some important instrumentation , like the buttons .
unfortunately , we have our work cut out for us .
i was born in calcutta -- a family where my father and his father before him were journalists , and they wrote magazines in the english language .
and what transpired was that people had put forward a hypothesis that was apparently coming up with some fabulous results by about 1995 .
would there be time to be able to work with it ?
and i wanted to come home and take a break and maybe start over .
malaria had been stuck .
and then we would put all of this into place in one neighborhood in what was the worst police district in the united states at the time .
so anyway , additionally , there was still this problem , and we were getting highly criticized as well for not dealing with all of these other problems .
so with two designers , tolga and christina , at my office , we took a track -- many of you probably know it . it &apos;s about 25 years old , and it &apos;s david byrne and brian eno -- and we did this little animation .
it &apos;s a choice . you might end up driving a taxicab .

these are the 15 commodities that fundamentally pose the biggest threats to these places because of deforestation , soil loss , water use , pesticide use , over-fishing , etc .
by companies asking for this , we can leverage production so much faster than by waiting for consumers to do it .
now what we &apos;re doing is bringing the ceos of these 80 companies together to help twist the arms of the final 20 , to bring them to the table , because they don &apos;t like ngos , they &apos;ve never worked with ngos , they &apos;re concerned about this , they &apos;re concerned about that , but we all need to be in this together .
what they &apos;ve realized is that if they can identify the traits on productivity and drought tolerance , they can produce 320 percent as much cocoa on 40 percent of the land .
it &apos;s been said that when an elder dies , it &apos;s as if a library is burned . anthropologist elizabeth lindsey , a national geographic fellow , collects the deep cultural knowledge passed down as stories and lore .

what &apos;s the context of this meal ?
jamie oliver is campaigning to save america from the way we eat .
environmental consideration was served with every plate , but it was served with a heaping mound of consideration for human interests at the same time .

three years ago , i was standing about a hundred yards from chernobyl nuclear reactor number four .
and you have to remember , these women have survived the worst atrocities of the 20th century .
the power of motherland so fundamental to that part of the world seems palliative .
so far , we have prototyped eight of the 50 machines .
so i &apos;ve been hearing color all the time for eight years , since 2004 , so i find it completely normal now to hear color all the time .
and also , some rachmaninov piano concertos as main dishes , and some bjork or madonna desserts , that would be a very exciting restaurant where you can actually eat songs .
and most people change their preference when i tell them that the one on the left is hitler and the one on the right is martin luther king .
the comments began pouring in , and okolloh would collate them . she would post them .
the world has over a trillion hours a year of free time to commit to shared projects .

the explanation of human behavior that we inherited in the 20th century was that we are all rational , self-maximizing actors , and in that explanation -- the daycare center had no contract -- should have been operating without any constraints .
we &apos;ll be able to change society .
so a few years ago , l.a. county decided that they needed to spend 2.5 billion dollars to repair the city schools .
but the back of my t-shirt , the one that she gave me , says , &quot; save the endangered hillbillies . &quot;

he grew up in the segregated south , escaped lynching and all that during some really hard times , and he provided a really stable home for me and my siblings and a whole bunch of other people that fell on hard times .
there goes my dog who led me to the park in my wedding .

the quarks are stuck together by other things called gluons .
so , you want to know why the sky is blue , why atomic nuclei stick together -- in principle , you &apos;ve got a big enough computer -- why dna is the shape it is .
now when a particle moves through the universe , it can interact with these higgs particles .
but actually , with this theory , we find that the forces of nature do seem to unify together , back at the big bang -- absolutely beautiful prophecy . the model wasn &apos;t built to do that , but it seems to do it .
and built this civilization , this wonderful picture , that turned the darkness into light , and you can see the civilization from space .
that means that you guys will soon be able to access one of these machines , if not this minute .

all this time you &apos;re -- when you think about hunger , it &apos;s a hard thing to think about , because what we think about is eating .
who is farming them ? that &apos;s what i was wondering .
it &apos;s the thirtieth anniversary of gmo crops and the big gulp , chicken mcnuggets , high fructose corn syrup , the farm crisis in america and the change in how we &apos;ve addressed agriculture internationally .
two young scientists break down plastics with bacteria
but we had a problem .
you see , i accidentally cracked the flask that had contained our third enrichment culture , and as a result , we had to wipe down the incubator room with bleach and ethanol twice .
we hope that in the near future , we &apos;ll be able to create model organisms that can break down not only phthalates but a wide variety of different contaminants .

&lt; speaker &gt; edward burtynsky &lt; / speaker &gt;
30 , 40 years from now , the children that i have , i can look at them and say , &quot; we did everything we possibly , humanly could do , to begin to mitigate this , what i feel is one of the most important and critical moments in our time . thank you .
and that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to describe to you today .
in fact , there is a new theory of autism called the &quot; intense world &quot; theory , which suggests that the neocortical columns are super-columns .
so it &apos;s very unlikely that you got the same fabric , the same circuitry .
so , the way that we can look at that is to ignore the neurons , ignore the synapses , and look just at the raw electrical activity .
these are images that come from hanna damasio &apos;s lab , and which show you , in a living brain , the reconstruction of that brain .
now to bring home the point of how close it is -- the relationship between the grid of neurons and the topographical arrangement of the activity of the neurons and our mental experience -- i &apos;m going to tell you a personal story .
and for a long time , people did not even want to touch it , because they &apos;d say , &quot; how can you have this reference point , this stability , that is required to maintain the continuity of selves day after day ? &quot;
you have , in effect , lost consciousness when you have damage to that red section of the brain stem .
the first two are shared with many , many other species , and they are really coming out largely of the brain stem and whatever there is of cortex in those species .
often , the good ideas are so staring-at-you-right-in-the-face that you kind of miss them . and i think , a lot of times , what we do is just , sort of , hold the mirror up to our clients , and sort of go , &quot; duh ! you know , look what &apos;s really going on . &quot;
it &apos;s about tiny things that can make a huge amount of difference .
so there &apos;s a whole series of just using your eyes , seeing things for the first time , seeing things afresh and using them as an opportunity to create new possibilities .
because we kind of have to -- we &apos;re just compelled to .
hammer it together . hammer it together with a shoe , if you &apos;re me , because they &apos;re impossible to assemble .
and , again , as designers , we wanted to make this thing incredibly beautiful and spend a lot of time thinking of the form .
good morning .
george h.w. bush : a new world order ...
well , the assumptions are wrong .
compare that with the ruling elites in both developed and developing countries , i think you &apos;ll find the party being near the top in upward mobility .
this is not a put-down of anyone . it &apos;s just a statement of fact .
democracy is becoming a perpetual cycle of elect and regret .
it is the universal claim that many western elites are making about their political system , the hubris , that is at the heart of the west &apos;s current ills .
so there is , in china , there is a different kind of mechanism to be responsive to the demands and the thinking of the people .
we can still make the pieces . we can make the right pieces .
we were hoping that it wass going to have a kind of evil , spidery walk , but instead it created this pretty lame way of moving forward .
there were two jeeps on santa cruz .
this is a picture of a galapagos penguin that &apos;s on the front of a little zodiac here in the galapagos .
they &apos;re not breeding ; they &apos;re not even around .

this is a radio frequency id system .
everybody knows somebody who &apos;s been diagnosed with cancer .
does it cause heart attacks , kill people , liver failure , this kind of thing ?
in fact , that early stage of the funding process , that phase i and pre-clinical stuff , that &apos;s actually , in the industry , called the valley of death because it &apos;s where drugs go to die .
we wanted people to get involved .
we &apos;re not looking to start a fund , but we want somebody else to do this .
and i felt overwhelmed .
and i think the way that we go through that sometimes can , first of all , disembody a group of people , individuals out there in the world .
and over and over again , as i interviewed them and spent my days with them , i did hear stories of life change and amazing little details of change .
a few months later , i went back to uganda with a digital camera and a basic website that my partner , matthew , and i had kind of built , and took pictures of seven of my new friends , posted their stories , these stories of entrepreneurship , up on the website , spammed friends and family and said , &quot; we think this is legal .
and if we can catalyze a supportive community to come around these individuals and to participate in their story by lending a little bit of money , i think that can change the way we believe in each other and each other &apos;s potential .
but there &apos;s always a need for resources close by .
so what i think i can do today , that best thing i can give you -- i &apos;ve given you my story , which is the best i can do .
i think inside at some point , we put our heads down on the pillow and we go , &quot; there &apos;s got to be more to life than this . &quot;
and she goes , &quot; well , i see jesus , &quot; and started crying and left .
so i believe , essentially , that leadership is stewardship .
but you may , you may .
now , that &apos;s a principle in the bible that says give 10 percent of what you get back to charity , give it away to help other people .
and i &apos;m going , what do i do with this notoriety that the book has brought ?
now , they &apos;re 13 miles up the road in santa ana .
but he doesn &apos;t do miracles just to show off .
and so , i &apos;m talking to the players , because most of the nba teams , nfl teams and all the other teams have done this 40 days of purpose , based on the book .
some people have the misguided idea that god only gets excited when you &apos;re doing , quote , &quot; spiritual things , &quot; like going to church or helping the poor , or , you know , confessing or doing something like that .
over the past two decades , since the end of the cold war , in the number of civil wars .
subsequent revisions of the agreement were facilitated by the british and irish governments , who never wavered in their determination to bring peace and stability to northern ireland .
and they need to think about the substance of their agreement much more than about the labels they want to attach to them .
and it has no dna .
it might be able to self-repair , and even respond to dramatic changes in the immediate environment .
so , in summary , i &apos;m generating metabolic materials as a counterpoise to victorian technologies , and building architectures from a bottom-up approach .
it &apos;s an article about a theater performance , and it starts with basic information about where it is , in case you actually want to go and see it after you &apos;ve read the article -- where , the time , the website .
you add all this up together and of course people are apathetic .
this , by the way , is my two-year-old nephew , guy .
and it &apos;s a global phenomenon .
they were willing to pay extra in order to wait .
controlled experiments have shown that optimism is not only related to success , it leads to success .
what this means is that warning signs such as these may only have limited impact .
so if i was to test all of you now , this is the amount that you would learn more from good news relative to bad news .
and this is good because it means we should be able to strike a balance , to come up with plans and rules to protect ourselves from unrealistic optimism , but at the same time remain hopeful .
we set out a clear action plan with goals and benchmarks .
and this is an important lesson , because it doesn &apos;t need to be a zero-sum game between moving traffic and creating public space .
we &apos;ve moved very , very quickly with paint and temporary materials .
one brooklyn paper called this bike lane that we have on prospect park west &quot; the most contested piece of land outside of the gaza strip . &quot;
we &apos;ve got dedicated lanes that keep cars out because they get ticketed by a camera if they use that lane , and it &apos;s been a huge success .
he called up the local newspaper , he got the interest of an investigative journalist , and that journalist actually found the real rapist , a man who ultimately confessed to this rape , a man who was thought to have committed 50 rapes in that area , and when this information was given to the judge , the judge set titus free .
like the jurors who convicted those innocent people and the jurors who convicted titus , many people believe that memory works like a recording device .
in one of the first studies we did , we used suggestion , a method inspired by the psychotherapy we saw in these cases , we used this kind of suggestion and planted a false memory that when you were a kid , five or six years old , you were lost in a shopping mall .
and when i suggested this publicly , it created an outcry again .
just to make it a little bit more exciting .
one month after mubarak stepped down , this was his reward .
and for us humans , it &apos;s not quite material , it &apos;s not really there -- it &apos;s virtual .
it &apos;s fairly simple .
we &apos;re all embedded in vast social networks of friends , family , co-workers and more . nicholas christakis tracks how a wide variety of traits -- from happiness to obesity -- can spread from person to person , showing how your location in the network might impact your life in ways you don &apos;t even know .
and how do they effect us ?
a kind of induction , a kind of spread from person to person .
we &apos;re going to put this into motion now , taking daily cuts through the network for about 30 years .
and so there &apos;s a very instinctive way in which we briefly transmit emotions to each other .
that &apos;s very obvious , we all know that .
so whether you find yourself in the middle or on the edge is also partially heritable .
and what i think the world needs now is more connections .
so i built a prosthetic baby , and i went into the village , pretended as though this baby had been born with a deformity , and here was the guys who do the killing .
official : he brought out some money from his pockets and put it on the table , so that we should not be afraid .
i have been there for a long time .

gabriel barcia-colombo : capturing memories in video art
but i &apos;d never done anything about myself .
for most people , if they think about hunger , they don &apos;t have to go far back on their own family history -- maybe in their own lives , or their parents &apos; lives , or their grandparents &apos; lives -- to remember an experience of hunger .
in fact , what we know now is that every 10 seconds we lose a child to hunger .
even if they know what they need to do , it &apos;s not available .
absolutely not .
perhaps most exciting to me is an idea that bill gates , howard buffett and others have supported boldly , which is to ask the question : what if , instead of looking at the hungry as victims -- and most of them are small farmers who cannot raise enough food or sell food to even support their own families -- what if we view them as the solution , as the value chain to fight hunger ?
we have to stand together .
your child will live a life ten years younger than you because of the landscape of food that we &apos;ve built around them .

fast food . with the fast-food industry you know , it &apos;s very competitive .
i truly believe that change will happen .
when we drive , we get into a glass bubble , lock the doors and press the accelerator , relying on our eyes to guide us -- even though we can only see the few cars ahead of and behind us . but what if cars could share data with each other about their position and velocity , and use predictive models to calculate the safest routes for everyone on the road ? jennifer healey imagines a world without accidents .
you and everyone else . this is the safe way to drive .
that &apos;s very nice about them .
if one guy has a really great car , but they &apos;re on their phone or , you know , doing something , they &apos;re not probably in the best position to react in an emergency .
but he doesn &apos;t know whether it &apos;s an infection , whether it &apos;s to do with malnutrition .
cochrane , he starts ranting at these germans in this scottish accent -- in fluent german , by the way , but in a scottish accent -- and explains to them how german culture was the culture that gave schiller and goethe to the world .

when i was a kid , i loved to draw , and the most talented artist i knew was my mother , but my mother was addicted to heroin .
when i was in the third grade , i wrote a book for the first time , &quot; the owl who thought he was the best flyer . &quot;
and to this day , i still can do karaoke to &quot; ice , ice baby &quot; without looking at the screen .
and i loved that thought , of being able to share my ideas through the printed page .
but it was around this time i went to camp sunshine to volunteer a week and working with the most amazing kids , kids with leukemia , and this kid eric changed my life .
so the next week i &quot; happened &quot; to be in new york .

but bandura has a step-by-step process that was super successful .
he &apos;s worked for ge , and he &apos;s had a fantastic career .
but doug &apos;s results that he cared about were much more qualitative .

when you graph the number of potential employees versus the number of jobs in the country , you see the gap gets bigger and bigger over time , and then , during the great recession , it opened up in a huge way .

throughout my career , i &apos;ve been fortunate enough to work with many of the great international architects , documenting their work and observing how their designs have the capacity to influence the cities in which they sit .
when a new inhabitant moves into the tower , they already have a roof over their head , so they just typically mark their space with a few curtains or sheets .
another place i &apos;d like to share with you is the zabbaleen in cairo .
what moved me the most was that despite these seemingly inhospitable conditions , i was welcomed with open arms into a home that was made with love , care , and unreserved passion .
now , many of you are probably saying , &quot; wait a sec , is this tough to do ? &quot;
young people would ask the most amazing questions .
now , i &apos;ve got a story for you .
in fact , i liked it so much that , instead of making my own project , i sent my mom links to about a dozen of these projects .
at the turn of the new year , new york city mayor michael bloomberg made a new year &apos;s resolution that he was going to learn to code in 2012 .
but instead of just playing someone else &apos;s game , you get to create the games , and if you see someone else &apos;s game , you can just say &quot; see inside , &quot; and you can look at the stacks of blocks that control it .
he took the block and he put it into the program exactly where the big fish eats the little fish .
so this is an example that came from after i had sent the mother &apos;s day cards to my mom , she decided that she wanted to learn scratch .
on the other hand , we kids still dream about perfection .
thank you bill gates and thank you ma .
please raise your hand right now if you think of yourself as a religious person .
i &apos;m going to play for you an excerpt from this book by glenn gray .
i &apos;m saying we are homo duplex and this staircase takes us up from the profane level to the level of the sacred .
the main argument against group selection has always been that , well sure , it would be nice to have a group of cooperators , but as soon as you have a group of cooperators , they &apos;re just going to get taken over by free-riders , individuals that are going to exploit the hard work of the others .
once they were all in the same tribe , they could keep the benefits of cooperation locked inside .
what &apos;s missing is that we are homo duplex , but modern , secular society was built to satisfy our lower , profane selves .
instead , we studied a little , tiny , round worm called c. elegans , which is just about the size of a comma in a sentence .
this is what &apos;s really cool : it &apos;s aging more slowly .
there &apos;s lots of hormones . there &apos;s testosterone , adrenalin .
as you age , you &apos;re much more likely to get cancer , alzheimer &apos;s disease , heart disease , all sorts of diseases .
so it can &apos;t turn the genes on .
and that &apos;s the case all over the world , as you can see from these stars .
ah , so the kinds of drugs i was talking about would not change the genes , they would just bind to the protein itself and change its activity .
if you look at birds , which live a long time , cells from the birds tend to be more resistant to a lot of different environmental stresses like high temperature or hydrogen peroxide , things like that .
of course , first you have breakfast , and then you fill the shell full of bondo and paint it and nail it up , and you have an architectural button in just a fraction of the time .
then , on the can it says , &quot; this is the famous budweiser beer , we know of no other beer , blah , blah , blah . &quot;
then , somebody gave me a bidet , so it got a bidet .
we &apos;ll go , &quot; ooh , that &apos;s nice . &quot;
so now we have standardized materials .
and that &apos;s what happened there .
we buy stuff we didn &apos;t know we needed .
the last thing is gregariousness .
i fail all the time , every day , and i &apos;ve had some whopping failures , i promise , big , public , humiliating , embarrassing failures .
this is not a copy .
that is why the printing press succeeded , and that is why martin luther nailed his 90 theses to the door : because he was complaining that the catholic church had gone amok in printing out indulgences and selling them in every town and village and city in all of western europe .
so hopefully tomorrow i &apos;ll show one or two more objects from the stage , but for today i just wanted to say thank you for all the people that came and talked to us about it .
and what does a lump of coal have to do with the internet ?
and if you are a boy , you &apos;re four times as likely to be diagnosed with adhd -- attention deficit hyperactivity disorder .
in a lot of classrooms today you &apos;re not allowed to write about anything that &apos;s violent .
and i &apos;m not very good at this , so i guess i &apos;d better go play video games or get into sports , or something like that , because i obviously don &apos;t belong here .
we want to live in lake wobegon where every child is above average , but what this does to our children is really not healthy .
they &apos;re nervous about anything that has anything to do with violence because of the zero tolerance policies .
i actually have no idea what my robot is going to do today .
ever see that little swiss army knife they have to fight with ?
you &apos;ve been a great audience .
the dotcom , ironically called snowball , was the very last consumer web company to go public the next month before nasdaq exploded , and i entered 18 months of business hell .
but something as basic as happiness , which 20 years ago would have been just something for discussion in the church or mosque or synagogue , today it turns out that there &apos;s dozens of ted-like questions that you can ask about it , which are really interesting .
the time scale on which ted operates is just fantastic after coming out of a magazine business with monthly deadlines .
and at that time two years ago i mentioned that we were speculating that these jets might in fact be geysers , and erupting from pockets or chambers of liquid water underneath the surface , but we weren &apos;t really sure .
so this is us climbing onto the trees and putting it up over the sayan valley in indonesia .
and if you look at a guy called dennis , when he decides what to become -- is it a lawyer , or does he want to become a doctor or a teacher ? -- best chance is that he wants to become a dentist .
and from that point of view we turned it into a lovely project .
so we started doing this . and you can see here on the horizontal axis you &apos;ve got the number of people killed in an attack or the size of the attack .
so we look at a process of group dynamics : coalescence and fragmentation , groups coming together , groups breaking apart .
and depending on who you ask , the surge was supposed to push it up even further .
you can add pop-ups with live links and custom icons , or pull in content from any web service , like flickr , or add articles and blog posts with links out to the full content .
laughter is contagious . passion is contagious .
show us the grades . &quot;
we said , take one idea , anything that bothers you , choose one week , and change a billion lives .
i know it &apos;s obvious , but i have to end with the most powerful symbol of change , gandhiji .
and the idea of the software was to gather information from sms , email and web , and put a map so that you could see what was happening where , and you could visualize that data .
we &apos;ve built a crowd map , we &apos;ve built ushahidi .
we can integrate over the surface , and the notation usually is a capital sigma .
this is actually from one of the original calculus videos .
and i want to pause here for -- i want to pause here for a second , because there &apos;s a couple of interesting things .
so i put a big c stamp on your forehead and then i say , &quot; here &apos;s a unicycle . &quot;
this is the blocking and tackling , making sure you know how to move through a system of equations , and it frees up time for the simulations , for the games , for the mechanics , for the robot building , for the estimating how high that hill is based on its shadow .
maybe we should put them in different classes . &quot;
sk : oh yeah . no , we have an awesome team working on it .
we made some of those for students so they could see their data , but we have a very tight design loop with the teachers themselves .
she changed her name to vivian because she wanted to fit in here in america .
but given my befuddled state of mind , i ended up in the self-help section very quickly .
if we &apos;re taught as leaders to just manage what we can measure , and all we can measure is the tangible in life , we &apos;re missing a whole lot of things at the top of the pyramid .
i asked him , &quot; how can you create and measure something which evaporates -- in other words , happiness ? &quot;
so it suggests that the momentum is shifting .
and yet , 64 percent of the world &apos;s gdp today is in that intangible industry we call service , the service industry , the industry i &apos;m in .
and then you extract them out of the ground , and sell them on the open marketplace .
now , over the last several years i spent a lot of time in europe , and particularly in the netherlands , and whenever i talk about the experience economy there , i &apos;m always greeted at the end with one particular question , almost invariably .
it &apos;s about supply and availability .
if not , you have , &quot; is not true to itself , &quot; and &quot; is not what it says it is , &quot; yielding a two-by-two matrix .
when you are there you are just immersed in this wonderful environment .
that &apos;s why you have companies like starbucks , right , that doesn &apos;t advertise at all .
for 30 years of his life , he made false papers -- never for himself , always for other people , and to come to the aid of the persecuted and the oppressed .
he was laughing so hard , he could not stop and he was holding my assignment in his hand .
so , his story . my father was born in argentina .
and suddenly the man started explaining that actually the whole resistance had a huge problem : even the top experts could not manage to bleach an ink , called &quot; indelible , &quot; the &quot; waterman &quot; blue ink .
one day my father introduced me to my sister .
europe was not spared either .
dimitar sasselov : how we found hundreds of potential earth-like planets
the telescope is actually built similarly to the , well-known to you , hubble space telescope , except it does have an additional lens -- a wide-field lens , as you would call it as a photographer .
and that &apos;s what the frustration was .
and we can find those that we would call habitable , meaning that they have similar conditions to the conditions that we experience here on earth and where a lot of complex chemistry can happen .
and a lot of the good news comes from that part of the bridge that we are trying to build as well .
you &apos;ve all learned that in school -- how small the earth is compared to the immense universe .
i mean look , you can see the necktie , but you can &apos;t even imagine seeing the size of a little , small atom .
despite their middle age , if you &apos;ve been following the themes of this conference or the entertainment industry , it &apos;s pretty clear that one has been picking on the other .
doesn &apos;t work out too well for them , they lose money .
since this computer was made in conjunction with the office of naval research , why don &apos;t we switch down to the pentagon in washington and let the navy &apos;s research chief , admiral bolster , give whirlwind the workout ?
this new computer , built to become the nerve center of a defense network , is able to perform all the complex mathematical problems involved in countering a mass enemy raid .
dec knew a good thing about wasting time .
turns out they told us directly that these are the only crayons you should ever use with your winky dink magic window , other crayons may discolor or hurt the window .
it &apos;s the era of big business and data centers for computing .
ph : by this time , computing had kind of leapt into media territory , and in short order much of what we &apos;re doing today was imagined in cambridge and silicon valley .
the digital highway arrived in america &apos;s living rooms late in the twentieth century .
well , you know where we &apos;re going on from here .
voice 2 : you mean we &apos;ll have to live here , together ?
and so every time a new medium arrives , the old medium is the content , and it is highly observable , highly noticeable , but the real , real roughing up and massaging is done by the new medium , and it is ignored .
obviously , there &apos;s always the dark side of it .
and even my mother -- i owe it to my family .
one of them is the ipi free media pioneer award .
a lot of young girls look up to me .
that thing .
and the very best of luck to you .
wouldn &apos;t it be great if our bodies could regenerate ?
this is the channel that connects the bladder to the outside of the body .
we take the cells , we expand them , we place the cells on the scaffold , and we then place the scaffold back into the patient .
they are not nearly as complex as hollow organs .
this is actually a simple solid organ like the ear .
we then take this vascular structure and we can prove that we retain the blood vessel supply .
a windpipe cell already knows it &apos;s a windpipe cell .
because our main goal , of course , is first , to do no harm .
but there are a lot of challenges for this .
and so we can also now virtually gain access to this even more distant organ system that , from the skeleton alone , has long decomposed .
and of course when science says cheese and chocolate help you make better decisions , well , that &apos;s sure to grab people &apos;s attention .
and this is how much they agree with the same article that did include a brain image .
you &apos;ve probably heard of it .
ask for the part of the story that &apos;s not being told .
all right , you &apos;ve all heard the term : &quot; he &apos;s a born surgeon . &quot;
if you think about the worldwide burden of trying to talk to your patients -- not just teaching surgeons , just trying to talk to your patients -- there aren &apos;t enough translators in the world .
it starts with a framework system where when the surgeon delivers the lecture using a framework of captioning technology , we then add another technology to do video conferencing .
this is a ubiquitous tool .
and it &apos;s africa that stands out as the problem down here , doesn &apos;t it ?
it was only by the turn of the century that more than 90 percent of the children survived their first year .
i think we have to go , there -- we have 2001 , or 2002 -- the united states has the same health as chile .
and this is when great-grandma was born , 1863 .
there is no one who has done it so far .
this is two to five dollars . you have a bed .
get us a mill so that we can mill our flour , then we will be able to pay for the rest ourselves . &quot;
i &apos;m telling you that there are many dimensions of development .
health i give two points . i mean it &apos;s nice to be healthy -- at my age especially -- you can stand here , you &apos;re healthy .
what you &apos;re drawn to are her eyes and the skin you love to touch .
so there are two things going on .
so we ran another group of babies in which the kids got the same dosage , the same 12 sessions , but over a television set and another group of babies who had just audio exposure and looked at a teddy bear on the screen .
the controversial website wikileaks collects and posts highly classified documents and video . founder julian assange , who &apos;s reportedly being sought for questioning by us authorities , talks to ted &apos;s chris anderson about how the site operates , what it has accomplished -- and what drives him . the interview includes graphic footage of a recent us airstrike in baghdad .
when we released that report , we did so three days after the new president , kibaki , had decided to pal up with the man that he was going to clean out , daniel arap moi , so this report then became a dead albatross around president kibaki &apos;s neck .
oops , i &apos;m sorry . what was going on ?
i mean , in general , what &apos;s your philosophy ?
but do you see any irony in the fact that , in order for you to shine that light , you have to , yourself , create secrecy around your sources ?
the material looks good , it feels right , but we just can &apos;t verify it . &quot;
j well , i was a journalist .
well , we just show the website instead , for all that time , as a filler , and we became very famous in iceland , went to iceland and spoke about this issue .
and so this is basically a song about loops , but not the kind of loops that i make up here .
and that &apos;s what the song is asking .
i &apos;ve always -- just as a listener , as just a fan -- i listen to that , and i &apos;m just astounded .
now when you &apos;re in an fmri scanner , you &apos;re in a big magnet that &apos;s aligning your molecules in certain areas .
and so what we did was we brought professional jazz players to the nih , and we had them memorize this piece of music on the left , the lower-left -- which is what you heard me playing -- and then we had them improvise to the same exact chord changes .
now what we did was we brought a musician into the scanner -- same way -- had them memorize this melody and then had another musician out in the control room trading back and forth interactively .
and so we &apos;ve done this actually on eight subjects now , and we &apos;re just getting all the data together , so hopefully we &apos;ll have something to say about it meaningfully .
this is a short video of how we actually do this in a scanner .
now there is an epidemic of obesity : two-thirds of adults and 15 percent of kids . what &apos;s really concerning to me is that diabetes has increased 70 percent in the past 10 years , and this may be the first generation in which our kids live a shorter life span than we do . that &apos;s pitiful , and it &apos;s preventable .
the same bribes and backhanders and things that take place under the table , it all takes place in the private sector .
we call it the section 34 fiasco , the section 34 fiasco , a suspicious piece of law , and i &apos;m going to say it like it is , a suspicious piece of law was passed at a suspicious time to free some suspects .
and he &apos;s telling us that for the $ 1.6 billion cost of the project , one billion dollars has been traced to offshore bank accounts .
in an unprecedented fit of generosity -- and you have to be very suspicious about these people -- in an unprecedented — and i &apos;m using that word carefully — unprecedented fit of generosity , the government of the day signed , made a written commitment , to repay all of the creditors .
the ministry of finance , we are told , is subject to the provisions of the freedom of information act .
the point is , that person made a career out of using the freedom of information act to advance his cause .
i could see what you &apos;re applying for .
a rating can range from a so-called aaa , which means it &apos;s a top-performing product , and it can go down to the level of the so-called bbb- , which means it &apos;s a fairly risky investment .
and we have developed the first model for a nonprofit rating agency for sovereign risk , and we call it by its acronym , incra .
and this is why we are testing our model right now , and why we are trying to find out if it can bring together a group of able and willing actors to bring incra to life .
and the list of scientific applications is growing every day .
i &apos;d like to show you a video of some of the models i work with .
it would be like having a clinical trial on a chip .
anybody ? anybody ? yeah !
and we &apos;re going to show you some today . so , let me introduce to you , some of our heroes right now .
&lt; speaker &gt; svante pääbo &lt; / speaker &gt;
and later , between 100 and 50,000 years ago or so , went out of africa to colonize the rest of the world .
it &apos;s easy to imagine how particularly those parts of our bodies were quickly influenced by selection from the environment and shifted frequencies of genes that are involved in them .
so having now a neanderthal genome on hand as a reference point and having the technologies to look at ancient remains and extract the dna , we can begin to apply them elsewhere in the world .
shlomo benartzi : saving for tomorrow , tomorrow
i see a lot of hands coming down .
and then they have to decide how they &apos;re going to invest in their 52 choices , and they never heard about what is a money market fund .
what does it have to do with time and savings , this issue of immediate gratification ?
in austria , again , nobody checks the box .
whether you think about immediate gratification , and the chocolates versus bananas , it &apos;s just painful to save now .
i want , really , to think about the fact that saving four times more is a huge difference in terms of the lifestyle that people will be able to afford .
there &apos;s a lot of opportunities to make it powerful again and again and again .
but here comes the art critic . oh , that was fantastic .
i consider myself the tide of shit .
so when i show the sims , i try to make people really feel what it meant to have an interaction with the sims , not only the fun but also the responsibility that came with the tamagotchi .
so when you see a gun , it &apos;s an instrument for killing in the design collection .
so the kind of interferences that you see here that look like beautiful barriers in the game are actually a consequence of the processor &apos;s limitedness , which is fantastic . so aesthetics is always important .
i want it to keep flying .
anyway , the second thing i want to say about dying in the 21st century , apart from it &apos;s going to happen to everybody , is it &apos;s shaping up to be a bit of a train wreck for most of us , unless we do something to try and reclaim this process from the rather inexorable trajectory that it &apos;s currently on .
he &apos;s very , very thin , and he is , indeed , very sick with pneumonia , and he &apos;s too sick to talk to me , so i talk to his daughter kathleen , and i say to her , &quot; did you and jim ever talk about what you would want done if he ended up in this kind of situation ? &quot;
so one of these will happen to all of us .
they loved it . the families and the patients , they loved it .
now , i &apos;m an aging hippie .
but i was intrigued .
and these were built with electronics obtained from radioshack instead of lockheed martin .
and soon , we &apos;ll turn our attention to launching a constellation of 24 or more of these satellites and beginning to build the scalable analytics that will allow us to unearth the insights in the petabytes of data we will collect .
live in the developing world .
the power lines are getting overloaded .
okay . okay .
so if you add these two together , alone , you can see a separation that nuclear puts out at least nine to 17 times more co2 equivalent emissions than wind energy .
we have facilities around there . you also have a buffer zone that &apos;s 17 square kilometers .
and i want two of each for the mics .
i used to be against nuclear power .
i campaigned against nuclear weapons in the &apos; 80s , and i continue to do so now .
two gigawatts comes through the chunnel .
okay . so here &apos;s the read on it .
the first one is the famous one , the printing press : movable type , oil-based inks , that whole complex of innovations that made printing possible and turned europe upside-down , starting in the middle of the 1400s .
we &apos;ve had the internet in its public form for almost 20 years now , and it &apos;s still changing as the media becomes more social .
and the chinese then , in one of their periods of media openness , decided that they were going to let it go , that they were going to let this citizen reporting fly .
they had to turn the spigot entirely off .
and then , this time last year , obama announced that he was going to change his vote on fisa , the foreign intelligence surveillance act .
even though it means changing the way we &apos;ve always done it . &quot;
they know this is the mass audience of the future ; they need to figure it out .
but my argument is that , if you want to understand the global village , it &apos;s probably a good idea that you figure out what they &apos;re passionate about , what amuses them , what they choose to do in their free time .
and i was wondering why nobody knew more about this dangerous grilled chicken , which doesn &apos;t seem very harmful .
i was the 17-18 year-old age category winner and then the grand prize winner .
and we wanted to figure this out , because if we could figure that out , then we might be able to prevent that resistance from ever happening .
with this question in mind , i started researching , and i soon found that indoor air pollutants were the culprit .
stop the use of incense and candles .
so &#91; as &#93; susan boyle was saying that , 80,000 live audience sang together .
and believe it or not , that was the first show on chinese television that allowed its hosts to speak out of their own minds without reading an approved script .
microblog boomed in the year of 2010 , with visitors doubled and time spent on it tripled .
among the 200 million migrant workers , 60 percent of them are young people .
similarly , many other issues concerning public safety is a hot topic on the internet .
happiness is not only related to personal experiences and personal values , but also , it &apos;s about the environment .
quite the similar idea , then , a perfume packaged in a book , in a die cut .
so we created this series of 99 portraits on tee shirts .
and i was pleased to see that he actually wrote the book while he was on sabbatical .
what does it say here ? monday , 8 to 9 : story writing ; 9 to 10 : future thinking .
which , when you actually have to design a beethoven poster , comes in handy , because the visual information of the logo and the actual poster is exactly the same .
this is after a week .
just a bit too ornamental .
the maasais , the boys are brought up to be warriors .
but most of all , the teacher was just writing on the board -- not hard work , that &apos;s what i thought , compared to what i was doing in the farm .
as i opened my leg , another woman came , and this woman was carrying a knife .
he got a stroke , and he was really , really sick , so he really couldn &apos;t tell me what to do next .
i enjoyed myself , but during that moment while i was here , i discovered a lot of things .
and they did . they donated land where we built the girls &apos; school .
you are somebody who is so passionate .
as you can see , he &apos;s heavily influenced by graffiti and street art , and his home city of mumbai is an ever-present element in his work .
a personal story , a collective triumph : dyan denapoli tells the story of the world &apos;s largest volunteer animal rescue , which saved more than 40,000 penguins after an oil spill off the coast of south africa . how does a job this big get done ? penguin by penguin by penguin ... &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
the other thing that was so striking was the sheer number of volunteers .
and it would take two people at least an hour just to clean one penguin .
and these are two things that each one of us actually has the power to do something about .
but he was right , it was a stupid idea .
you only do it one time .
to investigate this question , we ran an experiment where we had people watch a video of a father and his four year-old son , and his son has terminal brain cancer .
&quot; hey , a guy just found it . &quot;
but interestingly , high testosterone males are also more likely to use their own money to punish others for being selfish .
i also worried that my trust experiments with small amounts of money didn &apos;t really capture how often we actually trust our lives to strangers .
i &apos;m happy to share a little more love in the world , it &apos;s great , but here &apos;s your prescription from dr. love : eight hugs a day .
obviously the whole project here is huge .
and ivan puts his sandwich over here , on top of the pirate chest .
let &apos;s see what he does . here comes ivan .
so the first thing is that in children we see this same brain region , the right tpj , being used while children are thinking about other people .
and in fact , they say she deserves more blame in this case , the failed attempt to harm , than in another case , which we call an accident .
and then we can apply tms to the rtpj and ask how people &apos;s judgments change .
it &apos;s quite hard , actually , to get those very small changes .
the murder happened a little over 21 years ago , january the 18th , 1991 , in a small bedroom community of lynwood , california , just a few miles southeast of los angeles .
well , when you read through the case materials in this carrillo case , one of the things that suddenly strikes you is that the investigating officers said the lighting was good at the crime scene , at the shooting .
there &apos;s an arm sticking out of the passenger side and pointed back at you .
it &apos;s very different than most other cultures . all right ?
what i proposed first doing is looking at a different material palette to do that .
on the left , it &apos;s when it &apos;s cold and the thermo-bimetal is flat so it will constrict air from passing through the blocks , and on the right , the thermo-bimetal curls and allows that air to pass through , so those are two different components that i &apos;m working on , and again , it &apos;s a completely different thing , because you can imagine that air could potentially be coming through the walls instead of opening windows .
so , you know , it &apos;s sort of a complicated thing . you have these patterns of pulses coming out of your eye every millisecond telling your brain what it is that you &apos;re seeing .
what &apos;s the potential impact on a patient &apos;s ability to see ?
you might enjoy the awkwardly tight , cut-off pajama bottoms with balloons .
this is a project that scans the world &apos;s newly posted blog entries every two or three minutes , searching for occurrences of the phrases &quot; i feel &quot; and &quot; i am feeling . &quot; and when it finds one of those phrases , it grabs the full sentence up to the period and also tries to identify demographic information about the author .
these are the images that are automatically constructed .
i photographed that entire experience at five-minute intervals .
so this red strip signifies the color of the wallpaper in the basement apartment where i was staying .
this is the guys on the rope , pulling open the carcass .
a 17-year-old student . her wish was to have been born a boy .
she wanted a change in her life .
and this is what she said .
beau lotto + amy o &apos;toole : science is for everyone , kids included
your brain cannot deal with the uncertainty of that information , and it gets ill .
but we wondered if there &apos;s a possible link with other animals . it &apos;d be amazing if humans and bees thought similar , since they seem so different from us .
the one on the left is mine , okay ?
and i &apos;ll just read one .
now , true science education i think should be about giving people a voice and enabling to express that voice , so i &apos;ve asked amy to be the last voice in this short story .
so these are just a few of what are commonly known as smart materials .
so it &apos;s a little strange that i &apos;m standing here and saying , &quot; you must understand smart materials now . &quot;
we have found a new way to express our feelings and to express our dreams : these young people who have restored self-confidence in our nations in that part of the world , who have given us new meaning for freedom and empowered us to go down to the streets .
and now libya as you see it .
if you switch off the cameras tonight , there will be a genocide .
you are witnessing the birth of a new era .
i was born on a farm , a farm that was more than 50 percent rainforest &#91; still &#93; .
i saw deaths by thousands per day .
let &apos;s build the paradise again .
our forest in brazil , that antique forest that was the size of california , is destroyed today 93 percent .
land completely destroyed , the erosion there , the land had dried .
now , if i compare that to a cotton towel that i can use a thousand times , i don &apos;t have a whole lot of embodied energy until i wash that yogurty towel .
and so this is framing -- lumber , composite materials -- and it &apos;s kind of hard to get the embodied energy out of that , but it can be a sustainable resource if you use fsc-certified lumber .
ready to dance in your seat ? drummer clayton cameron breaks down different genres of music — from r &amp; amp ; b to latin to pop — by their beats . a talk that proves hip hop and jazz aren &apos;t cooler than math — they simply rely on it .
a-one-two-three-four , one-two-three-four , one-two-three-four , with me .
we have a brain for one reason and one reason only , and that &apos;s to produce adaptable and complex movements .
so it &apos;s a very simple algorithm .
so for example , if you put your hand under a table and try to localize it with your other hand , you can be off by several centimeters due to the noise in sensory feedback .
and the point about bayesian decision theory is it gives you the mathematics of the optimal way to combine your prior knowledge with your sensory evidence to generate new beliefs .
and if i &apos;ve got a good predictor , it predicts the same thing .
as you go from 0.1 to 0.2 , it becomes more ticklish at the end .
and what we see in all pairs of subjects is this -- a 70 percent escalation in force on each go .
here are two possible paths to that ball .
you only need to store things which are really going to effect movement .
so here is what we did . we put a 10-cent digital transponder , a data tag , in the appliance plug .
it &apos;s a pretty expensive machine .
and now this routine surgery that many of you have probably experienced , and others are probably the product of , has now become a tragedy .
the only difference is that now you &apos;re only working with 21 percent oxygen .
who gets surgery and who doesn &apos;t ?
so let &apos;s switch gears and look at a really complex problem courtesy of the u.s. government .
it was just one of those pot-luck things where you get it right first time .
i live opposite a farm . and this was the runt of the litter , a piglet that died .
so , i have to use a 1980s drum scanner , which was designed in the days when everyone shot photographs on film .
the coloring , so coloring adds another level to the x-rays .
so , these little details help to make it work , make it real .
but also i find that i &apos;ve got the benefit of taking away all the surface , which is things that people are used to seeing .
ursus wehrli : tidying up art
we can see here he started out with orange , and then he already ran out of orange , and here we can see he decided to take a break for a square .
i &apos;m not sure myself what it means but it sounds good anyway .
for example , with the keith haring circles and kandinsky &apos;s dots .
this is a picture by rene magritte , and i &apos;d like you all to inwardly -- like in your head , that is -- to tidy that up . so it &apos;s possible that some of you would make it like this .
yeah , maybe you &apos;re asking yourselves where old bruegel &apos;s people went ?
i think i inherit it from my mother , who , used to crawl around the house on all fours .
how come every other organ in your body can get sick and you get sympathy , except the brain ?
about 150,000 years ago , when language came online , we started to put words to this constant emergency , so it wasn &apos;t just , &quot; oh my god , there &apos;s a saber-toothed tiger , &quot; which could be , it was suddenly , &quot; oh my god , i didn &apos;t send the email . oh my god , my thighs are too fat .
and if there was a neurological cause , could we find a cure ?
after some time , however , we had a tentative answer .
the brain could only change within certain set limits .
this stimulates the amygdala and may be a more effective rehabilitative practice than simple incarceration .
believe it or not , this is a quote from an israeli prime minister , but it &apos;s not ben-gurion or golda meir from the era of the shah .
the soviet union collapsed , iraq was defeated , and a new environment was created in the region in which both of them felt more secure , but they were also now left unchecked .
iran and israel &apos;s conflict is a new phenomenon , only a few decades old in a history of 2,500 years , and precisely because its roots are geopolitical , it means that solutions can be found , compromises can be struck , however difficult it yet may be .
the virus has mutated dramatically in the last two years to form two distinct families , if you will , of the h5n1 viral tree with branches in them , and with different attributes that are worrying .
now you probably assume , well the governments are going to do something .
the vaccine will probably be useless .
you &apos;ll end up buying -- this is called an n95 mask . ridiculous .
most of the death toll was 15 to 40 year-olds -- robustly healthy young adults .
why are you still thinking that the lessons of katrina do not apply to flu ? &quot;
lg : right . so i have for a long time said that what we really needed was a rapid diagnostic .
it &apos;s this absolutely phenomenal disruption of the immune system that is the key to why people die of this virus .
the brain works by association .
and he &apos;s driving it all with this platform here , with a five-finger keyboard and the world &apos;s first computer mouse , which he specially designed in order to do this system .
so we didn &apos;t do it .
and at that time the focus in a lot of animal research was on aggression and competition .
one is reciprocity , and associated with it is a sense of justice and a sense of fairness .
another problem with elephants is that you cannot make an apparatus that is too heavy for a single elephant .
and empathy has sort of two qualities .
and so it is related to empathy , and that &apos;s the kind of expressions we look at .
so the final experiment that i want to mention to you is our fairness study .
the other one sees that .
and i think that &apos;s one of the main problems of our society .
life is not anymore just one line going in one direction in one dimension . no .
and i started to argue . i said , &quot; i &apos;m not going to do that .
i made a promise that the next time i would fly around the world , it would be with no fuel , independent from fossil energies , in order to be safe , not to be threatened by the fuel gauge .
for that , unfortunately , four meters wingspan is not enough .
the same time we load the batteries , we run the engines , and when we get at the maximum height , we arrive at the beginning of the night .
but much more , to get advices , to give your comments , to spread the word that if it &apos;s possible in the air , of course it &apos;s possible in the ground .
let &apos;s see where this hypothesis is going to lead us .
in the same way , a bubble of the ultra-dense higgs state could come into existence because of quantum tunneling .
in about five billion years , our sun will become a red giant , as large as the earth &apos;s orbit , and our earth will be kaput , and in a thousand billion years , if dark energy keeps on fueling space expansion at the present rate , you will not even be able to see as far as your toes , because everything around you expands at a rate faster than the speed of light .

and the reason i think it would be so interesting to you is because consciousness is so interesting .
and here are some of the other categories , if you look at the whole planet .
but the system has moved me on because , as my family started to discover , there is no long-term concept in the health care system .
and then i creep up to the point that i get a score of 79 , which is just below average .
the craniomandibular system is critical to that .
all consciousness is about communication .
gradually , i remembered the protector was my wife .
when i press it again , it &apos;ll chirp three times , and that &apos;ll mean that it &apos;s armed and ready to go .
you &apos;d think , there &apos;s plenty of paralyzed people in the world , but the audience is too small , and the amount of research , the time it takes , the fda clearances , the payback time is too long for v.c. to be interested .
so what i &apos;m going to show you is all of the main things , all of the main features of my discipline -- evidence-based medicine .
it is a description of the changes in one enzyme when you drip a chemical extracted from some red grape skin onto some cancer cells in a dish on a bench in a laboratory somewhere .
and they said , &quot; we &apos;ve done a trial .
we know from three different studies on three different types of pain that a saltwater injection is a more effective treatment for pain than taking a sugar pill , taking a dummy pill that has no medicine in it -- not because the injection or the pills do anything physically to the body , but because an injection feels like a much more dramatic intervention .
well it turns out that what happens is the negative data goes missing in action ; it &apos;s withheld from doctors and patients .
i read the trials on this . they were all positive . they were all well-conducted .
all of these things are happening in plain sight , and they &apos;re all protected by a force field of tediousness .
same was true for china .
that &apos;s also the reason google was pulled out from china , because they can &apos;t accept the fact that chinese government wants to keep the server .
so a suggestion , it &apos;s not good to go outside .
and even some of them were put into black jails .
they have everything in their hands .
so that &apos;s the update about this game , cat-and-mouse .
we have now discovered that there is a multi-directional transfer of nutrients between plants , mitigated by the mcyelium -- so the mycelium is the mother that is giving nutrients from alder and birch trees to hemlocks , cedars and douglas firs .
i &apos;ve been a scanning electron microscopist for many years , i have thousands of electron micrographs , and when i &apos;m staring at the mycelium , i realize that they are microfiltration membranes .
this was first discovered in 1859 .
battelle laboratories and i joined up in bellingham , washington .
this is a space-conservative method that uses storm debris -- and we can guarantee that we will have storms every year .
here &apos;s the selectivity index numbers -- against pox , you saw 10s and 20s -- now against flu viruses , compared to the ribavirin controls , we have an extraordinarily high activity .
it &apos;s been called an alexander graham bell patent .
so , we build the carbon banks on the planet , renew the soils .
we &apos;re seeing this in events like mumbai recently , where it &apos;s so much easier to report now than it is to consume it .
so , thank you very much .
and i &apos;m living proof .
consider this : starting right here at the convention center , we can find the nearby aquarium , we can look at where we &apos;re sitting , and then we can cruise up the coast to the big aquarium , the ocean , and california &apos;s four national marine sanctuaries , and the new network of state marine reserves that are beginning to protect and restore some of the assets we can flit over to hawaii and see the real hawaiian islands : not just the little bit that pokes through the surface , but also what &apos;s below .
in my lifetime , imagine , 90 percent of the big fish have been killed .
97 percent of the land in the galapagos islands is protected , but the adjacent sea is being ravaged by fishing .
i normally teach courses on how to rebuild states after war .
so my father and mother ended up in a sort of concentration camp , labor camp .
and it &apos;s for me a matter of justice for history , and accountability for the future , because cambodia remains a pretty lawless place , at times .
but you could feel sympathy for the reaction he had when he was told that his favorite painting was actually a forgery .
so one demonstration of this was done with young children .
but there &apos;s at least one case where capgras syndrome had a happy ending .
as my wife put it , &quot; you &apos;ve washed away the clooney cooties . &quot;
the question is : how much would people like joshua bell , the music of joshua bell , if they didn &apos;t know they were listening to joshua bell ?
the pain gets less .
the choir people in my high school were pretty geeky , and there was no way i was going to have anything to do with those people .
britlin was so innocent and so sweet , and her voice was so pure .
and he said , &quot; listen , this is the project i &apos;ve been looking for my whole life .
soprano : upon my pillow safe in bed ew : that &apos;s georgie from england . she &apos;s only nine .
when i placed a marker on the google earth map , i had to go with the nearest city , which is about 400 miles away from where i live .
these men were 10,000 miles from home , more than 1,000 miles from the nearest scrap of land .
the time had come for the men to make a plan , but they had very few options .
just like all great stories , our fears focus our attention on a question that is as important in life as it is in literature : what will happen next ?
why were they swayed by one story so much more than the other ?
it &apos;s already flattening out .
but hey , you &apos;re listening to me .
tables : forestry commission .
you can &apos;t get rid of waste .
the air handling system inside it -- i got rid of air-conditioning because i thought there was too much consumption going on there .
and no one &apos;s doing that just yet .
but on pine ridge , i will always be what is called &quot; wasichu , &quot; and &quot; wasichu &quot; is a lakota word that means &quot; non-indian , &quot; but another version of this word means &quot; the one who takes the best meat for himself . &quot;
the government also promises land and hunting rights in the surrounding states .
the american dream of individual land ownership turned out to be a very clever way to divide the reservation until nothing was left .
the court determined that , when the sioux were resettled onto reservations and seven million acres of their land were opened up to prospectors and homesteaders , the terms of the second fort laramie treaty had been violated .
as removed as we the dominant society may feel from a massacre in 1890 , or a series of broken treaties 150 years ago , i still have to ask you the question , how should you feel about the statistics of today ?
so in judaism , we have , from our torah , that you should love your neighbor as you love yourself .
there had to be limits to all things .
this &quot; 18 minutes &quot; business , i find quite fascinating .
&quot; oh god , i &apos;m in such trouble . i &apos;ve got children to feed .
&quot; of course , what you are doing , &quot; he said to the rich man , &quot; is answering god &apos;s plea that we should be compassionate .
we were looking forward to rebuilding it , but eight months after we moved in , i suffered a stroke-like attack caused by a birth defect .
i never thought i would be able to casually move around a campus like brown on my own .
and yes , it &apos;s an acrylic painting of a man , but i didn &apos;t paint it on canvas .
it &apos;s nearly impossible to get paint to stick to the grease in an egg .
peter van uhm is the netherlands &apos; chief of defense , but that does not mean he is pro-war . in this talk , he explains how his career is one shaped by a love of peace , not a desire for bloodshed -- and why we need armies if we want peace . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
in many countries people are confronted with guns .
no german soldier fell to the ground .
or is there something else ?
and i hope that one day armies can be disbanded and humans will find a way of living together without violence and oppression .
it &apos;s basically two ratios of per capita gdp , per capita gross domestic product , so average income .
that &apos;s a great question .
but this complement may be much inferior to what , with other laws and institutions , the nature of its soil , climate , and situation might admit of . &quot;
the scientific revolution was different from the science that had been achieved in the oriental world in a number of crucial ways , the most important being that , through the experimental method , it gave men control over nature in a way that had not been possible before .
that &apos;s the consumer society , and it propels economic growth more than even technological change itself .
this is the great reconvergence , and it &apos;s the biggest story of your lifetime .
complex civilizations do that , because they operate , most of the time , on the edge of chaos .
niall , thank you .
and this is about good taste , good traditions .
so what is happening ?
and this is where i have to query all of you .
and meat consumption in southeast asia and china in particular is what drives the prices of cereals .
we need to think that land is multi-functional .
and the kind of simplistic solutions that we sometimes have , to think that doing everything by hand is going to be the solution , is really not morally justified .
cameron herold : let &apos;s raise kids to be entrepreneurs
we could actually have all these kids spreading businesses instead of waiting for government handouts .
we fast-track . we figure out the game .
and my mom came into the room and she said , &quot; where are you going to get the coat hangers to sell to the dry cleaners ? &quot;

they had this old brass and copper .
right , like cutting lawns is brutal .
i &apos;m like , screw that . they &apos;re all in the pond and nobody &apos;s going into the pond .
supply , demand , big opportunity .
but i &apos;m teaching them to force that savings habit .
then the money they get , 50 percent goes in their house account , 50 percent goes in their toy account .
after these two days , and during a particularly intense encounter , it was presumed that the leader of la familia michoacana , nazario moreno , was killed .
and it so happens that this is a product that , because of its nature , a business model to address this market requires you to guarantee to your producers that their product will be reliably placed in the markets where it is consumed .
they focus most of their recruiting on the army , and they very openly advertise for better salaries , better benefits , better promotion paths , not to mention much better food , than what the army can deliver .
&#91; # 701 joaquin guzman loera &#93; like any multinational would , they have specialized and focused only in the most profitable part of the business , which is high-margin drugs like cocaine , heroine , methamphetamines .
and it was going to be a look at life through the kitchen .
and you must have seen this illusion .
i want you to think about illusion as a metaphor .
you see the netherlands is kind of the biggest of the small group .
how many of you believe that if you went to renew your license tomorrow , and you went to the dmv , and you would encounter one of these forms , that it would actually change your own behavior ?
so you refer the patient to hip replacement therapy .
do you want to go for a weekend to rome ?
so i decided to do the experiment that i would have loved the economist to do with me .

this is a man in his 20s whose first visit out of nigeria was with this malignant cancer that he came to the united kingdom to have operated on .
this is a little bangladeshi girl from the east end of london who &apos;s got a huge malignant tumor on the right side of her face , which has already made her blind and which is rapidly growing and is going to kill her shortly .
this is a horrific image , so i &apos;m putting my hand up now .
this is not a life-saving transplant -- like a heart , or liver , or lung transplant -- it is a quality-of-life transplant , and as a result , are the patients going to say , if they get a malignant cancer 10 or 15 years on , &quot; i wish i &apos;d had conventional reconstructive techniques rather than this because i &apos;m now dying of a malignant cancer &quot; ? we don &apos;t know yet .
at ted2009 , tim berners-lee called for &quot; raw data now &quot; -- for governments , scientists and institutions to make their data openly available on the web . at ted university in 2010 , he shows a few of the interesting results when the data gets linked up .
and i &apos;m delighted to see a great competition between the u.k. in blue , and the u.s. in red .
this is a real-time map that shows blocked roads , damaged buildings , refugee camps -- it shows things that are needed &#91; for rescue and relief work &#93; .
and that &apos;s one of the great dilemmas -- we &apos;re in a creativity session -- it &apos;s one of the great dilemmas in creativity : how to do work that &apos;s big enough and not sell out .
i don &apos;t see it the way you characterized it .
fg : yeah .
i tried to get him a couple of jobs and they didn &apos;t pan out .
rsw : i found the most remarkable thing .
fg : ask miriam !
since bilbao opened , which is now four , five years , both krens and i have been called with at least 100 opportunities -- china , brazil , other parts of spain -- to come in and do the bilbao effect .
luckily , i &apos;m old enough that i can complain i can &apos;t travel .
here &apos;s the overall picture .
now he &apos;s put together some thoughts : about half of that he &apos;ll cut , another half , perhaps in a very complex set of steps , taxes will be approved .
the forecast for the medical piece alone to 42 percent .
well there really is no brain trust .
in fact , there are some like these : erskine bowles , alan simpson and others , who have gone through and given proposals for this overall federal health-spending state-level problem .
and remember that all our cereal crops are grasses as well .
remember , that thing is just about 30 micrometers across .
where has it been ?
and so what i &apos;d like to do today is change your views , change your ideas and your thoughts about sleep .
so let &apos;s move to the brain .
now , that &apos;s the equivalent of a hot dog bun .
it &apos;s locked onto the same light-dark cycle as the rest of us .
so it &apos;s a short-term acute measure , but for goodness sake , don &apos;t become addicted to alcohol as a way of getting to sleep every night .
if you need an alarm clock to get you out of bed in the morning , if you are taking a long time to get up , if you need lots of stimulants , if you &apos;re grumpy , if you &apos;re irritable , if you &apos;re told by your work colleagues that you &apos;re looking tired and irritable , chances are you are sleep-deprived .
and the fourth myth is , early to bed , early to rise makes a man healthy , wealthy and wise .
in terms of the neuroscience , by understanding the neuroscience of these two systems , we &apos;re really beginning to understand how both sleep and mental illness are generated and regulated within the brain .
so , substantially larger than we even thought we would go initially .
we got a text from dan saying that , now , the first blue colonies existed .
so with that , i would like to open it first to the floor for questions .
but , more importantly , being seven means that you &apos;ve reached the age of reason , and you &apos;re now capable of committing any and all sins against god and man . &quot;
so , to find out that there was no santa claus at all was actually sort of a relief .
this was around the time that i started filling out physically , and i was filling out a lot more than a lot of the other girls , and , frankly , the whole idea that my astrological sign was a scale just seemed ominous and depressing .
and god came to lehi and said to him , &quot; put your family on a boat and i will lead you out of here . &quot; and god did lead them .
women &apos;s longer lifespan ? the fact that women tend to be much less violent than men ? but , no , it wasn &apos;t any of these gifts .

i think we &apos;re going to see a community of storytellers evolve and emerge .
i &apos;ve also lived in biosphere 2 .
and it was time for us to go in and give it a go .
when it came to our atmosphere , however , it wasn &apos;t that much of a joke over the long term , because it turned out that we were losing oxygen , quite a lot of oxygen .
and you might think , well , &quot; boy , your life support system was failing you . wasn &apos;t that dreadful ? &quot;
i had no idea what was in my food , where it came from .
and the mangroves were providing wood and honey and leaves for the animals , so that they could produce milk and whatnot , like we had in the biosphere .
this is the story of a rake in my backyard .
maybe there is a little bit of oxygen from some algae on the beach not far from here .
it was huge . to give you a sense of the scale , okay , there you go . the scale here is 50 miles on top , a hundred kilometers on the bottom . this thing was 300 kilometers across -- 200 miles -- an enormous crater that excavated out vast amounts of earth that splashed around the globe and set fires all over the planet , threw up enough dust to block out the sun .
another rock came into the earth &apos;s atmosphere and this one blew up above the ground , several miles up above the surface of the earth .
this is a rock that was about 30 yards across , so roughly the size of the ones that blew up over tunguska and hit arizona 50,000 years ago .
in the year 2005 , nasa launched a probe called deep impact , which slammed into -- slammed a piece of itself into the nucleus of a comet .
there &apos;s a group of scientists and engineers and astronauts and they call themselves the b612 foundation . for those of you who &apos;ve read &quot; the little prince , &quot; you understand that reference , i hope . the little prince who lived on an asteroid , it was called b612 .
we have the ability to change our future .
i realized there were a lot of people who weren &apos;t as gay as i was -- gay being happy , not gay being attracted to the same sex .
and i looked at it , and i was like , this is really cool .
when you get in front of this crowd , you &apos;re gonna share the news .
that is the reason why i felt it was imperative that i presented you with this copy of the gay agenda .
and they should be treated with love and respect .
this is project called ray .
it was done by a guy named goose .
it &apos;s also going to now happen in virtual spaces , and we have to get better at figuring that out .
and when i feel that way even the smallest act of kindness can make me cry .
and i was protecting the project from it , i realized . i was protecting it -- i didn &apos;t want this special , little group of photographs to get sullied in some way .
i was like , &quot; i don &apos;t know .

a few months ago , a 40 year-old woman came to an emergency room in a hospital close to where i live , and she was brought in confused .
bell says , &quot; what sort of crossing did you have on the ferry from burntisland ? &quot;
and so when auenbrugger became a physician , he began to do the same thing .
would he have substituted a computer screen for where he had the patient ?
it had a beautiful facility , giant atrium , valet parking , a piano that played itself , a concierge that took you around from here to there .
i then proceeded to tell the patient , once the patient was dressed , the standard things that the person must have heard in other institutions , which is , &quot; this is not in your head .
i remember so many patients , their names still vivid on my tongue , their faces still so clear .
on the fifth of december 1985 , a bottle of 1787 lafitte was sold for 105,000 pounds -- nine times the previous world record .
and it arrived , and it was tiny .
it was designed by the architect i.m. pei .
the olive oil that came in first was actually a bottle of whole foods 365 olive oil which had been oxidizing next to my stove for six months .
the lid closes , it self-cleans .
and cheval blanc is kind of an unusual wine for bordeaux in having a significant percentage of the cabernet franc grape .
any one of the wines served at this tasting , if i &apos;d been served it at a dinner party , it would have been , you know , the wine experience of my lifetime , and incredibly memorable .
in another south indian village , these boys here had assembled a video camera and were trying to take the photograph of a bumble bee .
sugata mitra : i took the experiment to south africa .
and i thought , i &apos;ll test them , they &apos;ll get a zero -- i &apos;ll give the materials , i &apos;ll come back and test them -- they get another zero , i &apos;ll go back and say , &quot; yes , we need teachers for certain things . &quot;
so their scores had gone up from zero to 30 percent , which is an educational impossibility under the circumstances .
the children enthusiastically got after me and said , &quot; now , what do you want us to do ? &quot;
you can &apos;t catch me .
they typed it into google , translated it into italian , went back into italian google .
as you surf the web , information is being collected about you . web tracking is not 100 % evil -- personal data can make your browsing more efficient ; cookies can help your favorite websites stay in business . but , says gary kovacs , it &apos;s your right to know what data is being collected about you . he unveils a firefox add-on , collusion , to do just that .
all of them are connected , as you can see , to form a picture of me on the web .
and as adults , we &apos;re certainly not alone .
and some days , that can even be a little scary .
but what we call it is r &amp; amp ; d-i-y , or research and develop it yourself .
so my co-teacher , sebastian thrun , and i thought , there must be a better way .
so we brought back the innovation of having due dates .
in the northwest corner of the united states , right up near the canadian border , there &apos;s a little town called libby , montana , and it &apos;s surrounded by pine trees and lakes and just amazing wildlife and these enormous trees that scream up into the sky .
but she was really amazed .
it &apos;s a lot of blindness .
and she said to me , she said , &quot; you know , margaret , i always used to say i didn &apos;t know what i wanted to be when i grow up .
i &apos;d done well at school . expectations for me were high , and i gleefully entered the student life of lectures , parties and traffic cone theft .
for example , i was part of a student tv station that broadcast news bulletins around the campus , and during an appointment which was running very late , i said , &quot; i &apos;m sorry , doctor , i &apos;ve got to go .
but together , they forged a blend of courage , creativity , integrity , and an unshakeable belief that my shattered self could become healed and whole .
i &apos;m now very proud to be a part of intervoice , the organizational body of the international hearing voices movement , an initiative inspired by the work of professor marius romme and dr. sandra escher , which locates voice hearing as a survival strategy , a sane reaction to insane circumstances , not as an aberrant symptom of schizophrenia to be endured , but a complex , significant and meaningful experience to be explored .
the violin , which meant everything to me , became a grave burden on me .
we spend roughly 60 percent of our communication time listening , but we &apos;re not very good at it .
well there are a lot of reasons for this .
how many birds am i hearing ?
but i believe that every human being needs to listen consciously in order to live fully -- connected in space and in time to the physical world around us , connected in understanding to each other , not to mention spiritually connected , because every spiritual path i know of has listening and contemplation at its heart .
the problem lies with us : we &apos;ve become addicted to experts .
i &apos;ve shared with you so far some insights into the world of experts .
by leveraging and by embracing the expertise within the company , best buy was able to discover , for example , that the store that it was going to open in china -- its big , grand store -- was not going to open on time .
by displaying despair , helplessness and hopelessness , the media is telling the truth about africa , and nothing but the truth .
support private investment in africa , both domestic and foreign .
you have to pay the army and the police to show law and order .
between 1960 and 2003 , our continent received 600 billion dollars of aid , and we are still told that there is a lot of poverty in africa .
it should be short enough to arouse interest , but long enough to cover the subject .
i got both of them .
and you can see there they &apos;re shopping with their helmets .
there &apos;s trains and planes and cars and bill o &apos;reilly , he &apos;s very noisy .
and i call it an epoxy method because -- it &apos;s not very appetizing . i understand that -- but -- but if you think about epoxy , what &apos;s epoxy ?
they become accessible to the yeast as food .
and then we take those units and we shape them . we give them a little pre-shape , usually a round or a little torpedo shape , sometimes .
again , transformed in stage 10 in the oven because what went into the oven as dough comes out in stage 11 as bread .
but most of those seeds get crushed and turned into flour .
enzymes are breaking forth sugars .
it &apos;s so deeply embedded in our psyches that bread is used as a symbol for life .
thank you . it &apos;s a distinct privilege to be here .
the synchrony of emotions that we experience when we hear an opera by wagner , or a symphony by brahms , or chamber music by beethoven , compels us to remember our shared , common humanity , the deeply communal connected consciousness , the empathic consciousness that neuropsychiatrist iain mcgilchrist says is hard-wired into our brain &apos;s right hemisphere .
first of all , i &apos;ve been programming in multiple other programming languages to get the basics down , such as python , c , java , etc .
and what we &apos;re learning is how powerful and dynamic these changes can be , that you don &apos;t have to wait very long to see the benefits .
and i want to suggest today that , in fact , that &apos;s wrong .
so instead of being antisocial with your money , what if you were a little more prosocial with your money ?
people who spent money on other people got happier .
human universal -- so you spend money on other people , you &apos;re being nice to them .
and they ask them , &quot; how happy are you with your life in general ? &quot;
and one way to think about it is for every 15 euro you give people for themselves , they put it in their pocket , they don &apos;t do anything different than they did before .
sometimes they send you pictures of them using the microscope .
my brothers and sisters were scattered .
my every moment .
it &apos;s like i &apos;m living a dream .
one testimony about how i find music is powerful is when i was still a soldier back then .
education enlighten your brain , give you so many chances , and you &apos;re able to survive .
audience : yes !
now , i &apos;ll show you a fun app that -- we &apos;ve been working on a collaboration with our friends at flickr .
yeah , yeah , back to the corner , back to the corner .
peter gabriel : fight injustice with raw video
text : &quot; between two fires : torture and displacement in northern uganda &quot; when we were at home , it was kony &apos;s &#91; rebel &#93; soldiers disturbing us .
and as the story of mr. morales , just down the road , excuse me , mr. gabriel , would you mind if we delayed your execution a little bit ?
the snow and the ice were my sandbox , and the inuit were my teachers .
thank you very much . i appreciate it .
they &apos;re not going to die of hypothermia .
and so i &apos;m just so happy that the dive is over .
they &apos;ve got that wryly smile on their mouth .
and he has a lot of experience with leopard seals . i have never seen one .
so that &apos;s all i had to work with at that point .
and then that wasn &apos;t enough ; she started to flip penguins onto my head .
thank you . thanks very much .
stanley milgram from the &apos; 60s and &apos; 70s , the creator of the small-world experiments , which became later popularized as six degrees of separation , made the point that any two arbitrarily selected people were likely connected from between five to seven intermediary steps .
&lt; speaker &gt; eve ensler &lt; / speaker &gt;
i didn &apos;t have patience for my body ; i snapped it into shape .
i heard about a little girl who couldn &apos;t stop peeing on herself because so many grown soldiers had shoved themselves inside her .
and i went to her house , and it was morning , and the morning new orleans sun was filtering through the curtains .
it was the realization that i had come very close to dying -- in the same way that the earth , our mother , is barely holding on , in the same way that 75 percent of the planet are hardly scraping by , in the same way that there is a recipe for survival .
i am six years old , and i don &apos;t cry when we leave home and we come to america , because i expect it to be a place filled with rare and wonderful things like bananas and chocolate and bazooka bubble gum , bazooka bubble gum with the little cartoon wrappers inside , bazooka that we &apos;d get once a year in ukraine and we &apos;d have to chew one piece for an entire week .
but he did have one thing .
people never want to say , i really don &apos;t understand .
so , when you &apos;re listening to itunes and your favorite music , that &apos;s really just a bunch of ones and zeros playing very quickly .
now , look around : just look next to your neighbor , look forward , look backward . we all look pretty different .
well , there &apos;s many things . some are exciting .
they &apos;ve also discovered that there &apos;s a heck of a lot of activity going on producing aroma as well .
we can start to figure that out .
there are microbes out there that actually make gasoline , believe it or not .
safely reaching the other side , i turned to the left , pushed the auto-button for the audible pedestrian signal , and waited my turn .
he was 36 . i was seven at the time .
some districts and cities have their own smell , as do places and things around you , and if you &apos;re lucky , you can even follow your nose to that new bakery that you &apos;ve been looking for .
&quot; bless you , man . &quot;
they want to earn a living .
where you say , like , &apos; 87 was like a good year , right ?
i said one day , well , look , if the science says -- this is science , not me -- that our poorest children lose ground in the summertime -- you see where they are in june and say , okay , they &apos;re there .
we know that the problem begins immediately .
and you &apos;ve never read a study from mit that says giving your kid dance instruction is going to help them do algebra better , but you will give that kid dance instruction , and you will be thrilled that that kid wants to do dance instruction , and it will make your day . and why shouldn &apos;t poor kids have the same opportunity ? it &apos;s the floor for these children .
you take me to any school .
every time something didn &apos;t work , we just threw in the towel and said , &quot; let &apos;s forget it . &quot; right ?
john legend : so what is the high school dropout rate at harlem children &apos;s zone ?
but when i say the word electric vehicle , people think about vehicles . they think about cars and motorcycles and bicycles , and the vehicles that you use every day .
i went to a very elitist , snobbish , expensive education in india , and that almost destroyed me .
what the poor thought was important would be reflected in the college .
a traditional bone setter is a professional .
he had one look at the soil and said , &quot; forget it . no way .
she actually looks after the teeth of 7,000 children .
he &apos;s my doctor . he &apos;s my lawyer .
he didn &apos;t know .
i said , &quot; i like the body language . i like the way she speaks . &quot;
&quot; haiti was not a natural disaster , &quot; says ted fellow peter haas : &quot; it was a disaster of engineering . &quot; as the country rebuilds after january &apos;s deadly quake , are bad old building practices creating another ticking time bomb ? haas &apos;s group , aidg , is helping haiti &apos;s builders learn modern building and engineering practices , to assemble a strong country brick by brick .
there is nothing here that we don &apos;t know .
ultimately , there are two ways that you can rebuild haiti ; the way at the top is the way that haiti &apos;s been building for decades .
so what you &apos;ve got to imagine here is this animal here moving across the african veld .
the thing is the sun is not always available to you , because at sunset it disappears below the horizon .
clearly the ground is very hot , and when the ground is hot , they dance more often , and when they do this particular dance , they wipe the bottom of their face .
it was a dental compound that we used to make these boots .
and what &apos;s taking place is that the beetle has got a home spot , it goes out on a convoluted path looking for food , and then when it finds food , it heads straight home . it knows exactly where its home is .
we know that the dance behavior is an orientation behavior and it &apos;s also a thermoregulation behavior , and we also know that they use a path integration system for finding their way home .
in fact , those with the most amazing superpowers are actually children , who smile as many as 400 times per day .
within two minutes , three people pass two-year-old wang yue by .
and i think that &apos;s why many of the most significant people in effective altruism have been people who have had backgrounds in philosophy or economics or math .
but you might be surprised to know that one of the careers that he encourages people to consider , if they have the right abilities and character , is to go into banking or finance .
that &apos;s another cause that i &apos;ve been concerned about all my life , the immense amount of suffering that humans inflict on literally tens of billions of animals every year .
but chris went on to say that he didn &apos;t think that what he &apos;d done was all that amazing , because he calculated that the number of life-years that he had added to people , the extension of life , was about the same that you could achieve if you gave 5,000 dollars to the against malaria foundation .
and so this is what they do .
after some time , after setting it on fire , you seal it to restrict the oxygen that goes into the kiln , and then you end up with this carbonized material here .
so we wanted to try to find a way to make a stronger briquette so that we could compete with wood charcoal in the markets in haiti .
but this is one of the incredibly rare situations where you also have economic benefits .
and we need to rethink our development strategies , so that we &apos;re not promoting educational campaigns to get them to stop being farmers , but rather to stop being poor farmers .
her apartment was an oasis .
now , that &apos;s a term coined by the institute of medicine .
and that &apos;s when she found us .
all three were nonsmokers .
our investigators have found that there are differences in the brains of women and men in the areas that are connected with mood .
thank you .
or at times , they would row out in their small currachs and kill it with a lance through the back of the neck .
and we try to guess what they &apos;re doing from their behavior on the surface .
colleagues from the isle of man last year actually tagged one shark that went from the isle of man all the way out to nova scotia in about 90 days .
and rus hoelzel came up with an effective population size : 8,200 animals .
so i was thinking that must have come from the shark .
so we were desperate .
but for the time being , thank you for that .
so it turns out there was a company across the river called google who had started a digitization project a few years back that might just enable this approach .
now again , we kind of caved in , and we did the very practical approach , which was a bit less awesome .
jm : now there are many other pictures that are worth 500 billion words .
now if you can wait a little bit , you should be an author , because then you rise to very great heights , like mark twain , for instance : extremely famous .
people talked about it twice less as it should have been .
actually , we &apos;re not going to have to talk , we &apos;re just going to show you all the slides and remain silent .
i used to work as the director of the world bank office in nairobi for east africa .
now , why did the world bank not let me do this work ?
and so there are still a lot of people who are not convinced that you have to stop bribing .
the ku klux klan is an ngo .
when you open this for growing oil palms you &apos;re creating co2 volcanoes that are emitting so much co2 that my country is now the third largest emitter of greenhouse gasses in the world , after china and the united states .
so basically the whole process of destruction had gone a bit slower than what is happening now with the oil palm .
so the idea is : how to integrate these flows in space , over time and with the limited means you have .
these sugar palms turn out to be fire-resistant -- also flood-resistant , by the way -- and they provide a lot of income for local people .
if you look at the number of tree species we have in europe , for instance , from the urals up to england , you know how many ?
if you would use a little bit of your technology to put tracking devices in trucks , and use google earth in combination with that , you could directly tell what palm oil has been sustainably produced , which company is stealing the timber , and you could save so much more carbon than with any measure of saving energy here .
and inside , we have this area for reforestation as a gene bank to keep all that material alive , because for the last 12 years not a single seedling of the tropical hardwood trees has grown up because the climatic triggers have disappeared .
&lt; speaker &gt; ken robinson &lt; / speaker &gt;
thank you very much . so , 15 minutes left .
what we do know is , if you &apos;re not prepared to be wrong , you &apos;ll never come up with anything original -- if you &apos;re not prepared to be wrong . and by the time they get to be adults , most kids have lost that capacity .
you &apos;d think it would be otherwise , but it isn &apos;t .
they all came into being to meet the needs of industrialism .
in fact , creativity -- which i define as the process of having original ideas that have value -- more often than not comes about through the interaction of different disciplinary ways of seeing things .
we walked in this room and it was full of people like me . people who couldn &apos;t sit still .
their relationship is a love story that feeds the earth .
al vernacchio : sex needs a new metaphor . here &apos;s one ...
let &apos;s take baseball and pizza and compare it when talking about three aspects of sexual activity : the trigger for sexual activity , what happens during sexual activity , and the expected outcome of sexual activity .
and then when we get together with someone for pizza , we &apos;re not competing with them , we &apos;re looking for an experience that both of us will share that &apos;s satisfying for both of us , and when you get together for pizza with somebody , what &apos;s the first thing you do ?
and in this case , difference is good , because that &apos;s going to increase the chance that we &apos;re having a satisfying experience .
thank you very much for your time .
but right now , most of the companies involved in these supply chains don &apos;t have any way of assuring us that nobody had to mortgage their future , nobody had to sacrifice their rights to bring us our favorite brand name product .
they actually do conduct a few investigations overseas -- about a dozen a year -- maybe 20 in a good year .
they &apos;re not legally liable .
this is a radical proposition , and it &apos;s crazy to think that if you &apos;re a 15-year-old bangladeshi girl leaving your rural village to go and work in a factory in dhaka -- 22 , 23 , 24 dollars a month -- your best chance of enjoying rights at work is if that factory is producing for a brand name company which has got a code of conduct and made that code of conduct part of the contract .
absolutely .
so i appeal to you .
we were trying to ski from this group of islands up here , severnaya zemlya , to the north pole .
i could see vividly , i suppose , being filmed out of the door of a helicopter , there was , kind of , rock music playing in the background , and i had a ski pole with a union jack , you know , flying in the wind .
we got to khatanga .
later in the expedition , the problem was no longer the ice .
stick a flag there , leave it there , pretty soon it will drift off , usually towards canada or greenland .
we &apos;d like to pick you up .
it &apos;s that little bar there . he put his hand on the throttle .
and there &apos;s a race to get to the pole between amundsen , the norwegian -- amundsen had dog sleds and huskies -- and scott , the british guy , captain scott .
my english lost , i wanted to vomit .
it said a windmill could pump water and generate electricity .
it &apos;s like a water dowsing device .
and whatever they were doing just before they got the reward , they repeat that particular pattern .
there was a natural selection for the propensity for our belief engines , our pattern-seeking brain processes , to always find meaningful patterns and infuse them with these sort of predatory or intentional agencies that i &apos;ll come back to .
in other words , the propensity to find these patterns goes up when there &apos;s a lack of control .
they increase the amount of dopamine .
and you see the lamp here , i know .
the one on the left . okay . so i &apos;ll rotate it so it &apos;ll be the one on the right .
there &apos;s somebody hiding behind there pulling the strings , whether it &apos;s the illuminati or the bilderbergers .
so i &apos;m going to end here with a short video clip that sort of brings all this together .
and , jennifer , how did that feel ?
but within 10 minutes , my father came outside , grabbed me by my forearm and led me into our room with an unfamiliar grip .
ted talk subtitles and transcript : photographer boniface mwangi wanted to protest against corruption in his home country of kenya . so he made a plan : he and some friends would stand up and heckle during a public mass meeting . but when the moment came ... he stood alone . what happened next , he says , showed him who he truly was . as he says , &quot; there are two most powerful days in your life . the day you are born , and the day you discover why . &quot; graphic images .
i was a very disturbed man because i saw the violence firsthand .
we have delivered live pigs to kenya &apos;s parliament as a symbol of our politicians &apos; greed .
there &apos;s nothing as powerful as that , knowing that i &apos;m meant to do this , because you don &apos;t get scared , you just continue living your life .
you &apos;re making 100 percent contrast between microcredit and regular investment and growing regular investment .
i was aware that i was the only girl who got to have such freedom , and i was guilty of it .
a lot of people were reaching out trying to raise awareness with us .
it was devastating -- like , oh , we can &apos;t actually do something about this ?
sughar is a local word used in many , many languages in pakistan .
it &apos;s incredible that someone so young could do achieve this much through so much force and ingenuity .
kb : this question has come to me a lot of times before , and i feel like the word &quot; fear &quot; just comes to me and then drops , but there is one fear that i have that is different from that .
i lived in this dome for four months with a crew of six , a very interesting experience , of course .
the first version was done in belgium and holland .
these people have been living there for a very long time and can be considered experts in sustainability , and so i &apos;m very interested to see what we can learn from them , and have an input of indigenous knowledge into space exploration .
so now i &apos;d like to perform a demonstration of this sock .
integrating these components , i was able to successfully create two prototypes , one in which the sensor is embedded inside a sock , and another that &apos;s a re-attachable sensor assembly that can be adhered anywhere that makes contact with the bottom of the patient &apos;s foot .
i &apos;m using clamps and ropes and all sorts of materials , weights , in order to hold things in place before i varnish so that i can push the form before i begin , so that something like this can become a piece like this , which is just made from a single dictionary .
i think that the book will evolve , and just like people said painting would die when photography and printmaking became everyday materials , but what it really allowed painting to do was it allowed painting to quit its day job .
so it &apos;s crazy stuff .
and systems theorists do tell us that the ease with which we can change a representation correlates to our willingness to improve the model .
big publishing company .
and as 30 mosques was blossoming around the world , i was actually stuck in pakistan working on a film .
feel free to cry , laugh , cross your legs , or do anything your body feels like doing .
before we were meant to travel , my mom came home one day , and said , &quot; we &apos;re going on a little holiday , a little trip . &quot;
we spent 15 minutes opening the tap like this .
one day , i was looking at the chart of the different types of female genital mutilation , fgm , i will just say fgm for short .
she &apos;s used to me mouthing off .
this doesn &apos;t talk about people like me .
and i didn &apos;t have one !
she said , &quot; i did what i had to do as a mother . &quot;
but imagine if this woman wasn &apos;t aware of what fgm was , if they never had that conversation ?
the aim of that is to get support for fgm victims in australia and to protect little girls growing up here to not have this evil done to them , because every child has a right to pleasure .
in fact , even now , when i was talking to people about what this talk was about , i made up a cover story and i even hid the truth about my ted talk .
how does her father feel ?
we &apos;ve all seen a group of ants , or some version of that , carting off your potato chip at a picnic , for example .
so this leads to the robot that i showed you earlier .
imagine these small robots running through that rubble to look for survivors .
for the past seven years , i have met and studied hundreds of entrepreneurs in india , china , africa and south america , and they keep amazing me .
frugal innovation is diametrically opposed to the way we innovate in the north .
let me give you an example .
the exciting news is that &apos;s starting to happen .
it was really just a small leftist insurgency and a devastating response by the state .
a piece , an essence , of who they are .
and he was captured on february 23 , 1984 .
people that 533 families are looking for .
that apparently you could walk across their backs from one end of the bay to the other .
the 200 years of whaling was clearly detrimental and caused a reduction in the populations of whales between 60 to 90 percent .
it &apos;s a wug .
so , for example , people are always telling you , &quot; be creative , make new music , do art , invent things , science and technology . &quot;
&quot; edutainment &quot; is a blend of &quot; education &quot; and &quot; entertainment . &quot;
you should make words because every word is a chance to express your idea and get your meaning across .
and this was when i realized that i needed to have more people join the cause because it &apos;s a big challenge .
&quot; not yet &quot; also gave me insight into a critical event early in my career , a real turning point .
they learn from it and they correct it .
in our country , there are groups of students who chronically underperform , for example , children in inner cities , or children on native american reservations .
on the other end of the network , you have folks who are interested in things like hip-hop music and they even identify with living in the dc / maryland / virginia area over , say , the baltimore city designation proper .
it &apos;s an incredibly rich set of data that we have about cities now , maybe even richer than any data set that we &apos;ve ever had before .
did you know this was happening ?
fortunately , there are steps we can take .
so he said , why don &apos;t we make a radio program marking the day of the german invasion of norway in 1940 .
and another funny thing : when the host on our main channel , after they have good news for you , she said , &quot; and on our second channel , the train has now nearly reached myrdal station . &quot;
what do you want us to film ? how do you want this to look ?
eight wires keep the camera stable .
this is the last project . it &apos;s the peep show .
so this is actually the whole running order for hurtigruten , 134 hours , just written on one page .
with this realization , i was free from the photojournalistic conventions of the newspaper and the magazine .
on the first day , my fixer , emine , and i cried with almost every woman who visited our studio .
this guerrilla -- and the main group is the farc guerrillas , revolutionary armed forces of colombia -- they have financed their war by kidnapping , by extortion , by getting into the drug trade , by illegal mining .
i want to tell you one of these stories .
but , as you can all imagine , it was very easy to counteract , because what was the guerrilla going to say ?
this generated , on average , a demobilization every six hours , so this was incredible and it was about : come home at christmas .
we &apos;d love to help .
they know .
what does it mean ?
so now , what i &apos;ve been working on for the last four years is to develop smart biomaterials , which are actually materials that will work with the body , helping it to heal and helping it to allow the wounds to heal normally .
now , this is a simulated arterial bleed — blood warning — at twice human artery pressure .
and i &apos;m talking about something far more valuable than office furniture .
our goal today is to come to an agreement on a very important proposal .
then , get in touch with the person who asked you to the meeting . tell them you &apos;re very excited to support their work , ask them what the goal of the meeting is , and tell them you &apos;re interested in learning how you can help them achieve their goal .
we published all those films for free on the internet , and we wanted to share all those films and represent music in a different way .
and i just had one phone number , actually , of one person .
that is now my new research i &apos;m doing on spirituality , on new spirits around the world .
you told me that most of the videos you have made are actually one single shot .
&lt; speaker &gt; michael green &lt; / speaker &gt;
it &apos;s not the greatest sound bite in the world , and it &apos;s dressed up in the cautious language of the economist .
today , i &apos;d like to introduce you to the social progress index .
but let me show you two other countries .
and that &apos;s good news , and that &apos;s what we &apos;ve seen over the last 20 , 30 years , with a lot of people lifted out of poverty by economic growth and good policies in poorer countries .
and this is just the beginning , you can create a social progress index for any state , region , city or municipality .
now , antibiotics have been used for patients like this , but they &apos;ve also been used rather frivolously in some instances , for treating someone with just a cold or the flu , which they might not have responded to an antibiotic , and they &apos;ve also been used in large quantities sub-therapeutically , which means in small concentrations , to make chicken and hogs grow faster .
gazelles have evolved to run faster because if they don &apos;t run faster , they would be lunch .
prices are important signals and we need to pay attention , but we also need to consider the fact that although these high prices seem unusual for antibiotics , they &apos;re nothing compared to the price per day of some cancer drugs , which might save a patient &apos;s life only for a few months or perhaps a year , whereas antibiotics would potentially save a patient &apos;s life forever .
an option is to go through that rethinking and carefully consider incentives to change how we do business .
we picked three houses in the center of the community and we start here . we made a few designs , and everybody liked this design of a boy flying a kite the best .
we figured that our ideas , our designs had to be a little bit more simple than that last project so that we could paint with more people and cover more houses at the same time .
they &apos;re even printing t-shirts , they &apos;re putting up banners explaining everything to everybody , and talking to the press .
a clue could be in this question we were asked 10 years ago .
it is accepted that for such an aim , knowledge creation , interaction among people , face-to-face contact , it &apos;s important , and we agreed on that .
&#91; in spanish &#93; loudspeaker : what kind of city do you want ?
it &apos;s poor and it &apos;s scarce .
in each situation , they found a way to talk about us and create that &quot; us &quot; idea .
and i &apos;m not saying this is easy , and i &apos;m sure many of you have made the wrong moves too about who you wanted to connect with , but what i want to suggest is , this is an opportunity .
we open ourselves up to those opportunities , and in this room are key players and technology , key players who are uniquely positioned to do this , to scale systems and projects together .
sure . people are always present in my photos , no matter whether they appear to portray tortoises or cougars or lions .
and it make sense . it &apos;s such a unique perspective .
we have to come up with responsible solutions that address the privacy issues and the safety , accountability issues but still give us that perspective .
so now we have two eyes in the sky . and now the trick is getting them back .
after a year , he still smelled putrid .
happily for us , almost everyone who &apos;s offered a prize decides to accept .
so he went to papua new guinea .
so she was always thinking after that about could there be some simple mask that was available everywhere when the unexpected happens .
there &apos;s only one left in the world : it &apos;s nine miles offshore and 65 feet down .
the pulse amplitude modulated fluorometer , or pam , gauges the fluorescence of corals as it pertains to pollutants in the water as well as climate change-related issues .
my father , &quot; how can people protect what they don &apos;t understand ? &quot;
initially , this too was amazing : growing economy , excellent infrastructure , and it seemed like it was a model for economic development in africa .
you say , &quot; let me try this way . &quot;
they &apos;re much more accountable to their people , they &apos;ve improved macroeconomic policies , and we are seeing for the first time africa &apos;s growing , and in fact it &apos;s the second fastest growing economic region in the world .
now , what i like about this story is that it shows that opportunities to create prosperity can be found almost anywhere .
nelson mandela once said , &quot; every now and then , a generation is called upon to be great .
hany &apos;s aunt , his uncle and his cousin were murdered in their homes for refusing to leave their house .
and she said yes , but she refused to smile .
so wealthy countries in the world should recognize the humanity and the generosity of the countries that are hosting so many refugees .
i spoke to him on skype the other day , and he was in his new university in florida pursuing his ph.d. in public health , and he proudly told me how he was able to raise enough funds from the american public to establish a health clinic back in his village back home .
so finally , they decided to do a biopsy , and two weeks later , the results of the biopsy came back .
and that is what makes micrornas such a promising biomarker for cancer , because as you know , cancer is a disease of altered gene expression .
since we believe early cancer detection should really be democratized , this entire solution costs at least 50 times less than current available methods , and we know that the community can help us accelerate this even more , so we &apos;re making the design of the device open-source .
see , we all know based on our own experience that when you sleep , it clears your mind , and when you don &apos;t sleep , it leaves your mind murky .
let me tell you about what we found .
now , i &apos;ve just talked a lot about waste clearance , but i haven &apos;t been very specific about the kinds of waste that the brain needs to be clearing during sleep in order to stay healthy .
when the opportunity came , i crossed two oceans , with borrowed money for airfare and only a $ 20 bill in my pocket .
so in nepal , the share of poor people was 42 percent in 1995 , the share of poor people in the population . by 2005 , a decade later , at a time of political crisis , economic crisis , the share of poor people went down to 31 percent .
there are .
actually , the savings would be larger than that 30 billion because remittance channels are also used for aid , trade and investment purposes .
i would love to invest in a bullet train system in india and i would love to contribute to efforts to fight malaria in my village .
and the best possible system that could be designed for it is one where the few make daily decisions in the name of the many .
and so the risk that we face is that we can create these huge power vacuums that will very quickly get filled up by de facto powers , like the military or highly motivated and already organized groups that generally lie on the extremes .
but , it also became very evident that technology was not going to do the trick .
our political system can be transformed , and not by subverting it , by destroying it , but by rewiring it with the tools that internet affords us now .
it was an experience of being totally in awe of the music , and i had not felt that in a long time .
as usual , there &apos;s a dozen kids there waiting to get picked up , but this time , the children &apos;s faces look weirdly similar , and you can &apos;t figure out which child is yours .
so here &apos;s how this works .
so have we finally nailed the case that this region is necessary for face recognition ?
next , i &apos;ll go through much more quickly some of the other specialized regions of the brain that we and others have found .
so it &apos;s been known for a very long time that that general vicinity of the brain is involved in processing language , but we showed very recently that these pink regions respond extremely selectively .
the brain could have been a single , general-purpose processor , more like a kitchen knife than a swiss army knife .
well , tonya is a great example of one of these women .
and to a man , they said , &quot; that &apos;s a given . &quot;
well , for women , the answer is obvious : we have to begin to focus more on developing and demonstrating the skills we have that show that we &apos;re people who understand our businesses , where they &apos;re headed , and our role in taking it there .
they made clear that a woman must not do a man &apos;s job .
as a palestinian female photographer , the journey of struggle , survival and everyday life has inspired me to overcome the community taboo and see a different side of war and its aftermath .
now , you probably all have heard the term big data .
if you have a cell phone , and that cell phone has gps , but even if it doesn &apos;t have gps , it can record your information .
arthur samuel knew something else .
it will improve our lives , but there are problems that we need to be conscious of , and the first one is the idea that we may be punished for predictions , that the police may use big data for their purposes , a little bit like &quot; minority report . &quot;
it &apos;s a little bit like the challenge that was faced by primitive man and fire .
at the same time , we have to recognize that in that period china has grown remarkably .
that would transform the relationship between human beings and the planet .
some things in cities can happen much more quickly .
we can see how to do that .
and it &apos;s not just stopping deforestation .
we can have better growth , better climate , a better world .
but the thing that i want to talk to you about today , the big idea that i want to discuss with you , is not that 3d printing is going to catapult us into the future , but rather that it &apos;s actually going to connect us with our heritage , and it &apos;s going to usher in a new era of localized , distributed manufacturing that is actually based on digital fabrication .
it was a fraction of a nasa spaceship , it costs a fraction of its cost , and it &apos;s made with less than a dozen moving parts , and it &apos;s going to be out in space later this year .
but chuck hull , the man that invented it all , is right here in the house today , and thanks to him , i can say , thanks to his invention , i can say that i am a cobbler too , and by standing in these shoes i am honoring my past while manufacturing the future .
i play sports at a four-year-old level , so what would happen is the kids would dribble around some cones , and then got hot , and then they would go sit underneath the tree where i was already sitting — — and i would just make up stories and tell them to them and i would tell them stories about my life .
adults can too , and we get there when we read .
so we have the echo park time travel mart .
i see it as kind of a book in three dimensions .
eliot gannon . &quot;
his voice is completely different , but he put his babysitter on the phone , and she was very nice to randolph as well .
interesting fact about marriage in russia , that most of the 18 , 19-year-old girls are already ready , and dream to get married .
in the last 20 years , how did the percentage of people in the world who live in extreme poverty change ?
here , you can see men went eight years .
the first thing to think about the future is to know about the present .
and ladies and gentlemen , for the first time , the informal results from a conference with u.s. media .
an excellent journalist knows how to pick the story that will make headlines , and people will read it because it &apos;s sensational .
basically meaning , we don &apos;t hire people who score like chimpanzees .
yeah , it &apos;s an unequal world , but when you look at the data , it &apos;s one hump .
i would say yes , extremely important , for the same reason .
these are just projections of gdp per capita into the future .
but i still didn &apos;t feel like i was making the world a better place .
so what we &apos;re proposing is really something that will add one football field of green space underneath this neighborhood , but more importantly will introduce a really community-driven focus in a rapidly gentrifying area .
we never spoke to each other for three decades , and then a couple of years ago , i decided to turn the spotlight on him .
they were built to transmit but not receive .
but it lent also an idea that actually he was being diminished or belittled by the policeman — as a 10-year-old boy , i saw that — but also there was an ambivalence towards authority .
when the book came out , it had fair reviews in the national papers , but the paper of choice in luton is not the guardian , it &apos;s the luton news , and the luton news ran the headline about the book , &quot; the book that may heal a 32-year-old rift . &quot;
but there &apos;s another way of looking at this photograph .
but to make afforestation as a mainstream business or an industry , we had to standardize the process of forest-making . so we benchmarked the toyota production system known for its quality and efficiency for the process of forest-making .
my husband is 76 .
after a very bad stroke , his ageless soul watches the changes in the body with tenderness , and he is grateful to the people who help him .
you know , for a vain female like myself , it &apos;s very hard to age in this culture .
we have contributed to society .
and she said , &quot; awesome . &quot;
the great pyramids were the tallest man-made structure in the world for 4,000 years .
you can &apos;t even buy a freaking t-shirt for that now .
which , incidentally , is only a third correct .
if someone is being abused online , do something .
a couple of weeks later , the international monetary fund visited us , and asked my minister , &quot; minister , it &apos;s great that you want to help farmers reach food security , but what if it doesn &apos;t rain ? &quot;
for credit , a farmer needs to earn the trust of a bank , and if it succeeds , the bank will advance him money .

and by the way , our special aversion to the risk of truly existential disasters depends on a philosophical and ethical question , and it &apos;s this : consider two scenarios .
usually , they were told that they were going to be exchanged for prisoners of war .
in all their simplicity , these items are the last testament to the identity of the victims , the last permanent reminder that these people ever existed .
that equals up to a little over five billion lunches made every school year .
since the 1950s , as the population of the medina grew , basic urban infrastructure such as green open spaces and sewage quickly changed and got highly stressed .
it &apos;s still under construction , but actually it is heavily used by the local population .
i spent so much of my life telling people the things they wanted to hear instead of the things they needed to , told myself i wasn &apos;t meant to be anyone &apos;s conscience because i still had to figure out being my own , so sometimes i just wouldn &apos;t say anything , appeasing ignorance with my silence , unaware that validation doesn &apos;t need words to endorse its existence .
i can &apos;t define who comes to us or how long they stay .
eventually i went back and i started as an officer there .
first , we started training our officers in teams rather than sending them one or two at a time to the state training academy .
system change is difficult and slow , and oftentimes it doesn &apos;t take you where you want to go .
i don &apos;t see my job as to punish them or forgive them , but i do think they can have decent and meaningful lives even in prison .
we need new and better ways to measure impacts on engagement , on interaction , on safe environments .
and you are rarely , if ever , seen by your actual doctor , just whoever happens to be working at the hospital that day .
do i go from a 30-percent chance to a 60-percent chance ?
so from the beginning of the menstrual cycle till the beginning of the next .
and it &apos;s not just about temperatures and it &apos;s not just about fertility ; we can use data about our bodies to tell us a lot of things .
and so like any good wife , i rush him to the emergency room at 2 o &apos;clock in the morning .
now , emergency room doctors are trained to make decisions quickly , but not always accurately .
audience : show me the data !
so i can talk about it now because i &apos;ve reached this point , where — i mean , i &apos;m 28 .
but as an artist who feels that their work is based solely on a platform of honesty and being real , that feels often like cheating .
so in collaboration with a clathrin expert tomas kirchhausen , we decided to create a new kind of model figure that showed all of that .

have you ever hoped that there was some ability you hadn &apos;t discovered yet that you were just naturally great at ?
i would take things like highlighter pen , mix it with water , pump it through plastic tubing , creating these glowing circulatory systems for people to walk through and enjoy .
so i started gathering a lot of different types of material in my studio and just experimenting and seeing what types of creatures i can come up with .
and by tracking an infant &apos;s gaze , we know that newborns as young as a day old can notice and respond to disruptions in order .
okay , good , because i need somebody smart here because now i &apos;m going to demonstrate with the help of one of you just how deeply rooted your urge to solve is , just how wired to solve all of you really are , so i &apos;m going to come into the audience and find somebody to help me .
and pick up another marker for me and take off the cap . isn &apos;t this fun ?
well this is the puzzle i present to you .
now let &apos;s take a look at another piece of the puzzle .
america suddenly was swept up by hysteria .
it became normal for me to go with my father to bathe in a mass shower .
we were denied service , and categorized as enemy non-alien .
they were greeted back on the white house lawn by president truman , who said to them , &quot; you fought not only the enemy but prejudice , and you won . &quot;
he writes , &quot; without the aid of prejudice and custom , i should not be able to find my way my across the room ; nor know how to conduct myself in any circumstances , nor what to feel in any relation of life . &quot;
many people , most people at the time , viewed the holocaust as sort of representing some tragic flaw on the part of the germans , some genetic taint , some authoritarian personality .
mccain is a celebrated war hero , and many people would explicitly say he has more of an american story than obama .
the story , perhaps apocryphal , is that president lincoln invited her to the white house in the middle of the civil war and said to her , &quot; so you &apos;re the little lady who started this great war . &quot;
and this principle of impartiality manifests itself in all of the world &apos;s religions , in all of the different versions of the golden rule , and in all of the world &apos;s moral philosophies , which differ in many ways but share the presupposition that we should judge morality from sort of an impartial point of view .
one evening , i was sitting out in my backyard in north carolina , and suddenly , these silent sparks rose up all around me , and i began to wonder : how do these creatures make light , and what &apos;s with all this flashing ?
in still other fireflies , both sexes use quick , bright flashes to find their mates .
when a female sees a flash from an especially attractive male , she &apos;ll aim her lantern in his direction , and give him a flash back .
but this time , the predator sneaks in a reply that cleverly mimics exactly what the other female just said .
what i &apos;d like to suggest , there are a number of habits that we need to move away from .
when those two things get conflated , you &apos;re listening into the wind .
but also , if you &apos;re really wishing somebody well , it &apos;s very hard to judge them at the same time .
this is the sing-song , the meta-language that we use in order to impart meaning .
warm up your voice .
i have talked about that on this stage in different phases .
next , i &apos;m going to say my frequency is 440 hertz , and i &apos;m going to let time advance by two seconds through this operation .
this thing actually has a glove you can put on your hands .
not that long ago , like only a hundred years ago — used to make music together as a common form of entertainment .
&lt; speaker &gt; naomi oreskes &lt; / speaker &gt;
one of the most famous examples comes from the work of albert einstein .
well the answer is because it made lots of predictions that came true .
a lot of science isn &apos;t deductive at all , it &apos;s actually inductive .
it &apos;s a model that &apos;s made with mathematics , and like the physical models of the 19th century , it &apos;s very important for thinking about causes .
it &apos;s a jury of men and women with ph.d.s , and unlike a conventional jury , which has only two choices , guilty or not guilty , the scientific jury actually has a number of choices .
they have to explain to us not just what they know but how they know it , and it means that we have to become better listeners .
we said , &quot; well , there &apos;s a need for good password data .
then some people had a much harder policy , and this was very similar to the cmu policy , that it had to have eight characters including uppercase , lowercase , digit , symbol , and pass a dictionary check .
do they actually help people have stronger passwords , and if so , which ones are better ?
so you can get a pass phrase like &quot; plan builds sure power &quot; or &quot; end determines red drug . &quot;
one of the things that i did is i made a number of quilts , and i made this quilt here .
or we think about things that make us happy , and we create our password based on things that make us happy .
before i go any further , let me clarify my role in all of this .
there are about 200 or 300 people who come , some of the best known linguists in the united states .
these complaints now strike us as quaint , if not downright adorkable -- -- but here &apos;s the thing : we still get quite worked up about language change .
if you look in the front matter of american heritage dictionaries , you can actually find the names of the people on the usage panel .
we &apos;re going to look pretty silly in a hundred years for worrying about &quot; impact &quot; as a verb and &quot; invite &quot; as a noun .
i &apos;m connected to 80,000 people around the world , and that &apos;s four madison square gardens full of cousins .
i found out i &apos;m connected to albert einstein , so i told my seven-year-old son that , and he was totally engaged .
i think the more inclusive the idea of family is , the better , because then you have more potential caretakers , and as my aunt &apos;s eighth cousin twice removed hillary clinton says -- — it takes a village .
in the middle of my ph.d. , i was hopelessly stuck .
so i turned to improvisation theater , and i told my students from day one what &apos;s going to happen when you start research , and this has to do with our mental schema of what research will be like .
it &apos;s based on the central principle of improvisation theater , so here improvisation theater came to my help again .
i &apos;ll try to make my lab as creative as possible , and if everybody else does the same , science will eventually become more and more better and better .
so my vision is that , just like every scientist knows the word &quot; atom , &quot; that matter is made out of atoms , every scientist would know the words like &quot; the cloud , &quot; saying &quot; yes , and , &quot; and science will become much more creative , make many , many more unexpected discoveries for the benefit of us all , and would also be much more playful .
the latest was in idaho just two weeks ago , and today we released a lawsuit challenging it as unconstitutional as a threat to journalism .
but the choices they make have dramatic outcomes that influence us all .
he reported it to the company , of course , but they ignored his report .
since then , they &apos;ve gone after many targets .
two years ago , i saw general keith alexander .
they can perform gymnastic maneuvers like no robot we have yet .
we put them in a materials testing machine to look at the stress strain analysis and showed that they can withstand forces 800 times their body weight , and after this they can fly and run so you never know where curiosity-based research will lead , and someday you may want a swarm thank you .
here &apos;s what we found .
now , in a perfectly rational world , these should be the same number , but we overpay for the opportunity to indulge our current preferences because we overestimate their stability .
and so , many of my early memories involved intricate daydreams where i would walk across borders , forage for berries , and meet all kinds of strange people living unconventional lives on the road .
&lt; speaker &gt; andrew solomon &lt; / speaker &gt;
and i said , &quot; pity ? &quot;
we don &apos;t seek the painful experiences that hew our identities , but we seek our identities in the wake of painful experiences .
people narrow the world and function in discrete groups without empathy for one another .
and i sometimes wonder whether i could have found such fulfillment in marriage and children if they &apos;d come more readily , if i &apos;d been straight in my youth or were young now , in either of which cases this might be easier .
on that day , a column of american and afghan troops were making their way through a part of afghanistan to help protect a group of government officials , a group of afghan government officials , who would be meeting with some local village elders .
i can &apos;t simply instruct two people to cooperate , and they will .
why can &apos;t you treat us like human beings ? &quot;
would anybody be offended if we gave a $ 150 million bonus to gandhi ?
i heard a story of some marines who were out in theater , and as is the marine custom , the officer ate last , and he let his men eat first , and when they were done , there was no food left for him .
we didn &apos;t get home till around four in the morning .
a bunch of people sent me this when it came out .
this is a college student &apos;s suggestion for what a &quot; four in the morning &quot; gang sign should look like .
there &apos;s a five in the morning .
at one point , it went , &quot; guys and dolls : the musical , &quot; &quot; last tango in paris , &quot; &quot; diary of a wimpy kid , &quot; &quot; porn star : legend of ron jeremy . &quot;
not the kind of librarian that takes her glasses off , lets her hair down , suddenly she &apos;s smoking hot .
they &apos;ve got lots of syllables .
that &apos;s closing the circle .
every culture has its own special food and national delicacy .
they simply don &apos;t secrete those odorless precursors that the bacteria love to use to produce the smells that in an ethnocentric way we always thought of as characteristic of armpits .
it &apos;s a connoisseur &apos;s reaction of delight , and it opens its mouth and sticks out its tongue and starts to suck .
so for example , one person asked , what would happen if you tried to hit a baseball pitched at 90 percent of the speed of light ?
so they go through a huge number of them .
it &apos;s quite a bit more than any other organization in the world has , as far as we know .
stanley mcchrystal : the military case for sharing knowledge
we had to change from who needs to know to the fact that who doesn &apos;t know , and we need to tell , and tell them as quickly as we can .
he also took a lot of documents that he didn &apos;t have the knowledge to know the importance of , so i think we need to learn the facts about this case before we make snap judgments about edward snowden .
mt : we love robots .
edi : yeah . it &apos;s all part of the illusion , marco .
&lt; speaker &gt; mellody hobson &lt; / speaker &gt;
i mean , why would anyone treat me differently ?
now , i do not raise this issue to complain or in any way to elicit any kind of sympathy .
we have to be color brave .
now , i told you , my mother , she was ruthlessly realistic .
they are blind from diseases that are either completely curable or preventable .
the issue of power supply is overcome by harnessing the power of solar .
&lt; speaker &gt; david epstein &lt; / speaker &gt;
listen to it again .
in 1972 , eddy merckx set the record for the longest distance cycled in one hour at 30 miles , 3,774 feet .
my arm span is exactly equal to my height .
what &apos;s happening when that happens is that the electrical impulse is causing all their muscle fibers to twitch at once , and they &apos;re throwing themselves across the room .
&lt; speaker &gt; wendy chung &lt; / speaker &gt;
and a common misconception is that vaccines cause autism .
it is not that genes account for all of the risk for autism , but yet they account for a lot of that risk , because when you look at fraternal twins , that concordance rate is only 31 percent .
as we did this , though , it was really quite humbling , because we realized that there was not simply one gene for autism .
they learn in a different way .
but it also left me in a really tricky position moving forward as an author trying to figure out how in the world i was ever going to write a book again that would ever please anybody , because i knew well in advance that all of those people who had adored &quot; eat , pray , love &quot; were going to be incredibly disappointed in whatever i wrote next because it wasn &apos;t going to be &quot; eat , pray , love , &quot; and all of those people who had hated &quot; eat , pray , love &quot; were going to be incredibly disappointed in whatever i wrote next because it would provide evidence that i still lived .
success catapults you just as abruptly but just as far way out over here into the equally blinding glare of fame and recognition and praise .
a computer is an incredibly powerful means of creative expression , but for the most part , that expression is confined to the screens of our laptops and mobile phones .
and this is a mapping application for disaster response .
and so it &apos;s not surprising , perhaps , that in july of this year , shark attack mitigation systems in collaboration with the university of western australia oceans institute made an announcement which captured the attention of the worldwide media and of ocean users and that was around the development of technology to mitigate or reduce the risk of shark attack based on the science of what sharks can see .
and from there , we were able to pinpoint two key characteristics : what patterns and shapes would present the wearer as hidden or hard to make out in the water , cryptic , the greatest contrast but provide the greatest so that that person wasn &apos;t confused for shark prey or shark food .
now that exact same shark had engaged , or encountered this sams rig , which is the elude sams rig , about eight minutes before , and spent six minutes circling it , hunting for it , looking for what it could smell and sense but not see , and this was the final engagement .
i learned so much from her .
but i stayed because i realized i was witnessing what &apos;s so rare to glimpse , that difference between success and mastery .
and he said , &quot; you learn how little you know . &quot;
it &apos;s what i have to imagine elizabeth murray was thinking when i saw her smiling at those early paintings one day in the galleries .
it &apos;s that pale blue dot of carl sagan &apos;s .
it &apos;s like water bending around a rock in a stream , and all that light just destroys the shadow .
it &apos;s about half the size of the one you just saw .
i have always wanted to do that .
specifically , i don &apos;t think we know what parenting is supposed to be .
when i was a kid , high school specifically , i was told that i would be at sea in the new global economy if i did not know japanese .
guess what it was ?
and i have to tell you , i think it leads to some very strange excesses .
i &apos;m not really sure how to create new norms for this world , but i do think that in our desperate quest to create happy kids , we may be assuming the wrong moral burden .
adam ii asks why we &apos;re here .
and we &apos;re often not taught to recognize the sin in ourselves , in that we &apos;re not taught in this culture how to wrestle with it , how to confront it , and how to combat it .
well , for a gunshot wound to the head and a traumatic brain injury , they typically can &apos;t tell you much .
pm : gabby , are you optimistic about your continuing recovery -- walking , talking , being able to move your arm and leg ?
they were working on some legislation that had to do with crime and punishment and capital punishment in the state of arizona .
kind of . the day after gabby was injured , i called my boss , the chief astronaut , dr. peggy whitson , and i said , &quot; peggy , i know i &apos;m launching in space in three months from now .
yeah , what have you learned ? gg : deeper . deeper .
i have to share this video of your most recent adventure .
&lt; speaker &gt; david sengeh &lt; / speaker &gt;
thank you very much .
the electron microscope fires electrons which creates images which can magnify things by as much as a million times .
what do rap shows , barbershop banter and sunday services have in common ? as christopher emdin says , they all hold the secret magic to enthrall and teach at the same time — and it &apos;s a skill we often don &apos;t teach to educators . a longtime teacher himself , now a science advocate and cofounder of science genius b.a.t.t.l.e.s. with the gza of the wu-tang clan , emdin offers a vision to make the classroom come alive .
you go to a black church , their preacher starts off and he realizes that he has to engage the audience , so he starts off with this sort of wordplay in the beginning oftentimes , and then he takes a pause , and he says , &quot; oh my gosh , they &apos;re not quite paying attention . &quot;
thank you .
they not only look desolate , they feel downright dangerous .
and he said to me on that very day , he said that new york was projected to grow from eight to nine million people .
so little by little , neighborhood by neighborhood , block by block , we began to set height limits so that all new development would be predictable and near transit .
i really love this park .
and when i was appointed , saving the first two sections of the high line from demolition became my first priority and my most important project .
thank you .
now , niemöller is offering a certain kind of insight .
now , this is the way aaron was .
i &apos;ve got three kids who hate to walk , and a wife who , it turns out , still hates when i &apos;m not there for mysterious reasons , so this was not an option , but the question i asked , could we remix granny d a bit ?
and so they developed a platform , which we are announcing today , that allows us to pull together voters who are committed to this idea of reform .
you could go online , you could look at pages , and they were put up either by organizations who had teams to do it or by individuals who were really tech-savvy for the time .
and again , it doesn &apos;t come from what you might think of as obvious information .
an example i often give is that , if i ever get bored being a professor , i &apos;m going to go start a company that predicts all of these attributes and things like how well you work in teams and if you &apos;re a drug user , if you &apos;re an alcoholic .
and sometimes that involves inferring things about them , but if users don &apos;t want me to use that data , i think they should have the right to do that .
bill gates : well , i think we were excited that there &apos;d be a phase of our life where we &apos;d get to work together and figure out how to give this money back .
which is an injection they were getting called depo-provera , which is a contraceptive .
the last decade , that number has dropped faster than ever in history , and so i just love the fact that you can say , okay , if we can invent new vaccines , we can get them out there , use the very latest understanding of these things , and get the delivery right , that we can perform a miracle .
and he knows when he comes home , even if it &apos;s to talk about the speech he did or the data or what he &apos;s learned , and i think we have a really collaborative relationship .
so there &apos;s a lot of collaboration .
you &apos;re spending , like , a billion dollars a year in education , i think , something like that .
she was very , very shy .
you &apos;ve easily got enough money despite your vast contributions to the foundation to make them all billionaires .
we look and go , &quot; wow . &quot;
well , i really think that most people here and many millions around the world are just in awe of the trajectory your lives have taken and the spectacular degree to which you have shaped the future .
now , that early universe was incredibly dense , like a metal , way denser , and if you hit it , it would ring , but the thing ringing would be the structure of space-time itself , and the hammer would be quantum mechanics .
what are the dates again ?
it &apos;s the same for other companies dealing at this sort of scale .
turns out there &apos;s some exceptions to that rule .
we wanted to give users the ability to add photos to their tweets .
but why do these groups form ?
they are part of an entire cavalcade of mind-controlling parasites , of fungi , viruses , and worms and insects and more that all specialize in subverting and overriding the wills of their hosts .
it is a critical and common part of the world around us , and scientists have now found hundreds of examples of such manipulators , and more excitingly , they &apos;re starting to understand exactly how these creatures control their hosts .
toxo infects mammals , a wide variety of mammals , but it can only sexually reproduce in a cat .
and while that idea may be disquieting , and while parasites &apos; habits may be very grisly , i think that ability to surprise us makes them as wonderful and as charismatic as any panda or butterfly or dolphin .
then , when i was about nine years old , we went to rome .
you see , i assumed that this was a modern roof that had been put on because the original was destroyed in some long-past war .
so then how do these projects of unprecedented creative vision and technical complexity like the pantheon actually happen ?
what imminent advance will be the equivalent of the pantheon ?
besides , once the first drivers explain to their confused car that the giant chicken at the fork in the road is actually a restaurant , and it &apos;s okay to keep driving , every other car on the surface of the earth will know that from that point on .
but why is blood red ?
as the iranian government found out when , through a series of front companies , it owned a building in the very heart of manhattan , on fifth avenue , despite american sanctions .
and if you don &apos;t want to involve anyone else , it doesn &apos;t even have to be an actual human being .
but this was an awful tragedy , and it shouldn &apos;t have been so difficult just to try and find out who was responsible for those deaths .
the u.k. government is already on board ; it supports these public registries .
and i got my pressure suit built around me and rode down outside in the van heading out to the launchpad -- in the astro van -- heading out to the launchpad , and as you come around the corner at the kennedy space center , it &apos;s normally predawn , and in the distance , lit up by the huge xenon lights , is your spaceship -- the vehicle that is going to take you off the planet .
i was inspired as a youngster that this was what i wanted to do .
and so a spider lands on you , and you go through this great , spasmy attack because spiders are scary .
and not just underwater , but also in virtual reality labs with the helmet and the gloves so you feel like it &apos;s realistic .
so in fact , when our crew was coming back into the atmosphere inside the soyuz , we weren &apos;t screaming , we were laughing ; it was fun .
now invariably , you &apos;re probably thinking about what belongs to our own species , these very familiar structures , but the diversity that we see in sexual structures in the animal kingdom that has evolved in response to the multitude of factors surrounding reproduction is pretty mind-blowing .
they stab it anywhere in her body , and the sperm simply migrates through her hemolymph to her ovaries .
we &apos;ve also seen a titillation strategy pleasing their female partners into choosing them now unfortunately , in the animal kingdom , it &apos;s the coercion strategy that we see time and time again .
but deep down , i knew that the right decision was to go home , even if i didn &apos;t fully recognize the woman who was making that choice .
now , when we go , fewer and fewer businesses close for siesta , reflecting the advance of global corporations and 24-hour competition .
we know that lots of women still judge the attractiveness of a man based in large part on how successful he is in his career .
ajit narayanan : a word game to communicate in any language
and that &apos;s why a sentence like &quot; i want soup tonight &quot; is different from a sentence like &quot; soup want i tonight , &quot; which is completely meaningless .
you do that by changing the word &quot; want . &quot;
so long as the questions are standardized , so i call this freespeech , and i was playing with this for many , many months .
it &apos;s also one-dimensional because our mouths are built that way .
it might be very easy for us to actually create these engines in many , many different languages , in hindi , in french , in german , in swahili .
they are these huge collections of galaxies , bound together by their mutual gravity .
so this is the main idea , but science is a rough draft .
what i don &apos;t expect is that it go up at an ever-increasing rate .

the idea is that , as part of human nature , from the beginning of our species &apos; time , men have sort of leased women &apos;s reproductive potential by providing them with certain goods and services .
you can choose to be a vegetarian , but don &apos;t think that just because you &apos;ve made that decision , bacon suddenly stops smelling good .
that &apos;s what the external testicles are .
my hope is that a more accurate , updated understanding of human sexuality will lead us to have greater tolerance for ourselves , for each other , greater respect for unconventional relationship configurations like same-sex marriage or polyamorous unions , and that we &apos;ll finally put to rest the idea that men have some innate , instinctive right to monitor and control women &apos;s sexual behavior .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m trying to get at .
it &apos;s called pmma , and it &apos;s now used in millions of people every year and helps in preventing cataracts .
and it actually works really well , because it &apos;s your own bone , and it &apos;s well vascularized , which means it &apos;s got a really good blood supply .
and i &apos;m just going to tell you , sometimes those contacts are very strange , slightly unexpected , and the very most interesting , let me put it that way , contact that i had , was actually from a team of american footballers that all wanted to have double-thickness skulls made on their head .
and you can either put them into the heart or into the blood system , but either way , we don &apos;t seem to be able to get quite the right number of cells getting to the location we want them to and being able to deliver the sort of beautiful cell regeneration that we would like to have to get good clinical outcomes .
now that &apos;s millions of people worldwide who are using generic voices , including professor hawking , who uses an american-accented voice .
now i told you earlier that i &apos;d spent a good part of my career understanding and studying the source characteristics of people with severe speech disorder , and what i &apos;ve found is that even though their filters were impaired , they were able to modulate their source : the pitch , the loudness , the tempo of their voice .
that &apos;s not the novel part .
all we need is a few hours of speech from our surrogate talker , and as little as a vowel from our target talker , to create a unique vocal identity .
see , i told you this is the really juicy stuff .
and in gold , we see a subset of companies rated as having the best esg performance .
so i &apos;m not talking about tradeoffs here .
aparna rao : art that craves your attention
and you immediately see how the unsteady nature of the video suggests the presence of an observer and a subjective point of view .
it could be anything from a few feeble claps from members in the audience , or it could be a very loud ovation .

they have figured out how to peel off the tire , how to thread it and interlock it to construct a more efficient retaining wall .
all these red lines are the invisible political institutions that were inscribed in that leftover empty space .
server : would you like any desserts , sir ?
i was greatly influenced by art , and i wanted to incorporate it in everything i did , even my business .
it takes to get it through your hearts , because when you get it through your heart , that is when movements are sparked .
so we took er-1 to the evaluation room .
it &apos;s a mathematical model , but it &apos;s not complicated .
and in fact , this model is obviously false , because in reality , meerkats are anything but random particles .

so this petition started to take off -- humongously fast , you have no idea .

now , we &apos;ve all heard of distance education , but the students way in the back , 200 feet away from the instructor , i think they are undergoing long-distance education .
it &apos;s got two sounds : a grunt and a silence .
they can solve problems together .
they can rewind the professor .
when we did our circuits course for the 155,000 students , i didn &apos;t sleep for three nights leading up to the launch of the course .
thank you . thank you .
let &apos;s take an example .
who will pay for that ?
simple rule number one : understand what others do .
it changes everything .
i &apos;m not using this phrase metaphorically , the ceiling actually collapsed one day in our living room .
and it &apos;s the same structure , just the motion is different .
i took off from a ph.d. i went to acting classes .
you can see when i psych it out , it gets fooled .
a few years later , i was at my next research job at georgia tech in atlanta , and i was working in a group dealing with robotic musicians .
to sort of show that it doesn &apos;t like what the other person is playing -- and maybe show whatever beat it &apos;s feeling at the moment .
and i thought , what would happen if your speaker dock didn &apos;t just play the music for you , but it would actually enjoy it too . and so again , here are some animation tests from an early stage . and this is what the final product looked like .
you never talk about being a woman , because someone might notice that you &apos;re a woman , right ?
felling like i didn &apos;t belong there , feeling guilty to this day .
it &apos;s so striking . &quot; lean in &quot; is very global , i &apos;ve been all over the world , talking about it , and -- cultures are so different .
ss : well , there &apos;s certainly more dialogue , which is great .
and yet the book is being read , as you say , in rural and developing countries .
if you are a black woman , 64 cents .
i said , &quot; the menu , please . &quot;
so , you want us to use arabic . where are we to do so ?
regardless of the who , how and why .
we turned this into a concern of the civil society , and we launched a campaign to preserve the arabic language .
so , if we can &apos;t reach space or build a rocket and so on , we can be creative .
let &apos;s get rid of this cultural cringe .
the most famous body of water on the earth today , i imagine , cuba to florida .
and each time i get done with ooh , you may say i &apos;m a dreamer but i &apos;m not the only one 222 .
what a foundation you lay down in reaching for those horizons .
sixty-four , that no one at any age , any gender , could ever do , has done it , and there &apos;s no doubt in my mind that i am at the prime of my life today .
and so this talk is going to be for him .
he would never have a lot of money , but he was to be one of the richest men i would ever meet .
it &apos;s a very strange sensation having another creature try and eat you , and there are few things that promote vegetarianism like that .
houses are shared . food is shared .
the next day i watched again as the matriarch broke a branch and she would put it in her mouth , and then she would break a second one and drop it on the ground .
&lt; speaker &gt; dambisa moyo &lt; / speaker &gt;
the fact of the matter is that this has become a very poignant question because there is for the first time in a long time a real challenge to the western ideological systems of politics and economics , and this is a system that is embodied by china .
i &apos;m here to also tell you that there are lots of shifts occurring around what china is doing in the democratic stance .
instead of going around the world and haranguing countries for engaging with china , the west should be encouraging its own businesses to trade and invest in these regions .
thank you very much .
our story of our life is based on direct experience , but it &apos;s embellished .
and that &apos;s not all .
for us as individuals who live in the digital now and spend most of our waking moments in it , the challenge is to live in two streams of time that are parallel and almost simultaneous .
it threatens the flow of love .
it &apos;s seen as the problem now , for most people .
there &apos;s not enough tax revenue , there &apos;s not enough philanthropic donations , to deal with these problems the way we &apos;re dealing with them now .
but i &apos;ve also , over the years , worked more and more on social issues .
and guess what ? that &apos;s happening now , finally , partly because of people like you who have raised these issues now for year after year and decade after decade .
i find this a particularly apt description of science and how science works -- bumbling around in a dark room , bumping into things , trying to figure out what shape this might be , what that might be , there are reports of a cat somewhere around , they may not be reliable , they may be , and so forth and so on .
this is the stuff that &apos;s exhilarating and interesting .
i have to get out of here actually . i have to go read .
so i &apos;d say the model we want to take is not that we start out kind of ignorant and we get some facts together and then we gain knowledge .
knowing a lot of stuff , the purpose is to be able to ask lots of questions , to be able to frame thoughtful , interesting questions , because that &apos;s where the real work is .
these are just plain old molecules , but if you sniff those molecules up these two little holes in the front of your face , you will have in your mind the distinct impression of a rose .
so in second grade , all the kids are interested in science , they like to take stuff apart . they have great curiosity .
because that &apos;s what we want people to do , and that &apos;s how you evaluate them .
to do this , there &apos;s only two simple steps to follow .
xl : now , for the switch we have been talking about , ideally , the switch has to act really fast .
what we can do is we can take our mice and then we can put them in a box that looks exactly like this box here , and then we can give them a very mild foot shock so that they form a fear memory of this box .
clearly it &apos;s freezing .
it &apos;s sort of like making a remix tape .
so let &apos;s think together as a team about what this all means and where we can and should go from here , because xu and i think we all have some really big decisions ahead of us .
as i looked down at her in the bed , i thought to myself , if you just tried caring even a little bit , you wouldn &apos;t be in this situation at this moment with some doctor you &apos;ve never met about to amputate your foot .
but most important , i was left with these three burning questions that wouldn &apos;t go away : how did this happen to me if i was supposedly doing everything right ?
so what i &apos;m suggesting is maybe we have the cause and effect wrong on obesity and insulin resistance .
for the past year , i &apos;ve been fortunate enough to work on this problem with the most amazing team of diabetes and obesity researchers in the country , and the best part is , just like abraham lincoln surrounded himself with a team of rivals , we &apos;ve done the same thing .
you needed my empathy and compassion , and above all else , you needed a doctor who was willing to consider maybe you didn &apos;t let the system down .
he got an environmental health guy .
i want you all to select one of the houses of the 25 houses you see on the screen .
and the same test for the electrical system and the toilets .
it &apos;s one of the almost rock-solid pieces of evidence , which i &apos;ve never seen evidence for , that &apos;s always ruled out as that &apos;s the problem with indigenous housing .
then we wanted to get rid of the bug generally .
later we found the leading cause of illness and death in this particular region is through respiratory failure .
the common link between all the work we &apos;ve had to do is one thing , and that &apos;s poverty .
